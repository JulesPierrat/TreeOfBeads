Data analysis seeks to understand both first-order (environmental) effects and second-order (interaction) effects. Approaches that are both data-driven (exploration of geospatial data) and model-driven (testing hypotheses and creating models) are included. Data driven techniques derive summary descriptions of data, evoke insights about characteristics of data, contribute to the development of research hypotheses, and lead to the derivation of analytical results. The goal of model driven analysis is to create and test geospatial process models. In general, model-driven analysis is an advanced knowledge area where previous experience with exploratory spatial data analysis would constitute a desired prerequisite. Visual tools for data analysis are covered in Knowledge Area: Cartography and Visualization (CV) and many of the fundamental principles required to ground data analysis techniques are introduced in Knowledge Area: Conceptual Foundations (CF). Image processing techniques are considered in Knowledge Area: Geospatial Data (GD). All of the methods described in this knowledge area are more or less sensitive to data error and uncertainty as covered in Unit GC8 Uncertainty and Unit GD6 Data quality. Mastery of the educational objectives outlined in this knowledge area requires knowledge and skills in mathematics, statistics, and computer programming.",

We now make a distinction between analysis (or analytical operations) and analytical models (often referred to as “modelling”). And by analysis we actually mean only a subset of what is usually implied by the term: we do not specifically deal with advanced statistical analysis (such as cluster detection or geostatistics).\r\n\r\nAnalysis of spatial data can be defined as computing new information to provide new insights from existing spatial data. Consider an example from the domain of road construction. In mountainous areas, this is a complex engineering task with many cost factors, including the number of tunnels and bridges to be constructed, the total length of the tarmac, and the volume of rock and soil to be moved. GISs can help to compute such costs on the basis of an up-to-date digital elevation model and a soil map. The exact nature of the analysis will depend on the application requirements, but computations and analytical functions can operate on both spatial and non-spatial data.",

The “goods” transported can be almost anything: people, cars and other vehicles along a road network, commercial goods along a logistic network, phone calls along a telephone network, or water pollution along a stream/river network.\r\n\r\nDirect vs. Non-directed Networks\r\nA fundamental characteristic of any network is whether the network lines are considered to be directed or not. Directed networks associate with each line a direction of transportation; undirected networks do not. In the latter, the “goods” can be transported along a line in both directions. We discuss here vector network analysis, and assume that the network is a set of connected line features that intersect only at the lines’ nodes, not at internal vertices. (But we do mention under- and overpasses.)\r\n\r\nPlanar vs. Non-Planar Networks\r\nFor many applications of network analysis, a planar network, i.e. one that can be embedded in a two-dimensional plane, will do the job. Many networks are naturally planar, such as stream/river networks. A large-scale traffic network, on the other hand, is not planar: motorways have multi-level crossings and are constructed with underpasses and overpasses. Planar networks are easier to deal with computationally, as they have simpler topological rules. Not all GISs accommodate non-planar networks, or they can only do so using “tricks”. These tricks may involve the splitting of overpassing lines at the intersection vertex and the creation of four lines from the two original lines. Without further attention, the network will then allow one to make a turn onto another line at this new intersection node, which in reality would be impossible. In some GISs we can allocate a cost for turning at a node—see our discussion on turning costs below—and that cost, in the case of the overpass trick, can be made infinite to ensure it is prohibited. But, as mentioned, this is a work around to fit a non-planar situation into a data layer that presumes planarity. The above is a good illustration of geometry not fully determining the network’s behaviour. Additional application-specific rules are usually required to define what can and cannot happen in the network. Most GISs provide rule-based tools that allow the definition of these extra application rules.",

            "description": "Identifying and listing all elements does not describe a system in full. There may be many different ways in which elements may be connected or related to each other. The interactions, relationships between elements are essential to describe a system.\r\n\r\nRelationships between elements can be described by two types of flows:\r\nflows of material, and flows of information.\r\n\r\nMaterial flows connect elements between which there is an exchange of some substance. This can be some kind of material (water, food, cement, biomass, etc.), energy (light, heat, electricity, etc.), money, etc. It is something that can be measured and tracked. Also if an element is a donor of this substance the amount of substance in this element will decrease as a result of the exchange, while at the same time the amount of this substance will increase in the receptor element. There is always a mass, or energy conservation law in place. Nothing appears from nothing, and nothing can disappear to nowhere.\r\n\r\nThe second type of exchange is with an information flow. In this case element A gets information from element B. Element B at the same time may have no information about element A. Even when element A gets information about B, B does not lose anything. Information can be about the state of an element, about the quantity that it contains, about its presence or absence, etc. Information flows can be used to describe rules and policies. Information flows can modify the rates of flow between elements, they can switch certain processes and interactions on and off. But the process through which policies, interventions and norms for action are established, and could for example define the values of such information flows, are themselves the result of social interaction between relevant stakeholders from public, private or civil society.\r\n\r\nThe simplest is to acknowledge the existence of a relationship between certain elements, like this is done in a graph. In a graph a node presents an element and a link between any two nodes shows that these two elements are related. However there is no evidence of the direction of the relationship: we do not distinguish between the element x influencing element y or vice versa. This relationship can be further specified by an oriented graph that shows the direction of the relationship between elements. An element can be also connected to itself, to show that its behaviour depends on its state. We can further detail the description by identifying whether element x has a positive or negative effect on element y.\r\n\r\nWith networks, interesting questions arise that have to do with connectivity and network capacity. These relate to applications such as traffic monitoring and watershed management. With network elements—i.e. the lines that make up the network—extra values are commonly associated, such as distance, quality of the link or the carrying capacity.",

The aim is to find a sequence of connected lines to traverse from the origin to the destination at the lowest possible cost.\r\n\r\nIn Optimal-path finding, the cost function can be simple: for instance, it can be defined as the total length of all lines of the path. The cost function can also be more elaborate and take into account not only length of the lines but also their capacity, maximum transmission (travel) rate and other line characteristics, for instance to obtain a reasonable approximation of travel time. There can even be cases in which the nodes visited add to the cost of the path as well. These may be called turning costs, which are defined in a separate turning-cost table for each node, indicating the cost of turning at the node when entering from one line and continuing on another. This is illustrated in Figure 1 of the examples.\r\n\r\nProblems related to optimal-path finding may require ordered optimal path finding or unordered optimal-path finding. Both have as an extra requirement that a number of additional nodes need to be visited along the path. In ordered optimal-path finding, the sequence in which these extra nodes are visited matters; in unordered optimal-path finding it does not.",

The typical case arises when we want to determine drainage patterns in a catchment area: rain water “chooses” a way to leave the area. \r\n\r\nWe can illustrate the principles involved in this typical case with a simple elevation raster. For each cell in that raster, the steepest downward slope to a neighbour cell is computed and its direction is stored in a new raster. This computation determines the elevation difference between the cell and the neighbour cell and it takes into account cell distance - 1 for neighbour cells in N–S or W–E direction, 2 for cells in a NE–SW or NW–SE direction. From among its eight neighbour cells, it picks the one with the steepest path to it. The directions thus obtained in an output raster are encoded in integer values, which can be called the flow-direction raster. From this raster, the GIS can compute the accumulated flow-count raster, a raster that for each cell indicates how many cells have their water flow into that cell.\r\n\r\nCells with a high accumulated flow count represent areas of concentrated flow and may, thus, belong to a stream. By using some appropriately chosen threshold value in a map algebra expression, we may decide whether they do or not. Cells with an accumulated flow count of zero are local topographic highs and can be used to identify ridges.",

The term data model can refer to two distinct but closely related concepts. In relation to the field of geoinformation the term data model refers to the set of concepts used in defining such formalizations as entities, attributes, relations, tables which is implemented by a mathematical construct for representing geographic objects or surfaces as data. There are two most frequently used data models, which are vector and raster. For example, the vector data model represents geography as collections of points, lines and polygons and more complex structures crated from these three. The raster data model represent geography as cell matrices that store numeric values. Among these two data models we also stand out data formats in which data sets can be stored. File format is a standard of encoding geographical information into a computer file. There are the following basic file formats for encoding data:\r\nFor vectors:\r\n-\tShapefile\r\n-\tGeography Markup Language (GML)\r\n-\tXYZ Point Cloud\r\n-\tGeoJSON\r\n-\tGeoMedia\r\n-\t\r\nFor rasters:\r\n-\tGeoTIFF\r\n-\tIMG\r\n-\tJPEG2000\r\n-\tEsri grid\r\nThe GIS projects often require the conversion of the data formats. Data conversion is the process of moving data from one format to another, whether it is from one data model to another or from one data format to another. Data conversion is a complex process which is not only associated with changing the binary format of the file but also requires changing the structure of the data. For example, the GML data format always comes with an UML diagram, which is necessary to convert attributes stored in GML structure for example to a table of contest in a shapefile data format. In a well-managed GIS project it is important to store data in specific data model or data format. It is sometimes dictated by software capabilities and another times by team’s technical capabilities. With large amounts of geographic data used in the project it is more cost-effective to convert the data from one format to another than re-create it.",

The raster data are made of pixels or grid calls and can be represented by the discrete - categorical data (e.g. land cover map) or non-discrete - continuous data (e.g. satellite images, surface data). The process of conversion of vector to raster data is called rasterization. The vector to raster conversion requires the following parameters: the field value from the attribute table used to assign values to the output raster, the pixel size for the output raster, the output raster format (i.e. geotiff, img) and optionally the method of assigning values of point, polyline or polygon to the call raster, i.e. maximum length or area, cell centre. The output of the rasterised vector looks like a gridded version of the vector and it depends on the grid cell size. The process of vectorisation refers to the conversion of raster to vector dataset. The raster dataset can be converted to vector point, polyline or polygon. In order to convert raster to vector the following parameters should be provided: attribute field of the input raster dataset which will become an attribute in the output vector class, determining if the output polygon or polyline will be smoothed into simpler shapes or conform to the input raster's cell edges (stair stepping). For each raster pixel or grid cell a point will be created at the centre of the cell.

The resampling process calculates the new pixel values from the original digital pixel values in the uncorrected image. There are three common methods for resampling: nearest neighbour, bilinear interpolation, and cubic convolution. The nearest neighbour resampling uses the digital value from the pixel in the original image which is nearest to the new pixel location in the corrected image. This is the fastest interpolation method, which is primarily applied for discrete (categorical) raster data as it does not change the value of the pixel, but may result in some pixel values being duplicated while others are lost. Bilinear interpolation resampling takes a weighted average of four pixels in the original image nearest to the new pixel location. The averaging process alters the original pixel values and creates entirely new digital values in the output image. It is recommended for continuous data and it cause some smoothing of the data. Cubic convolution resampling is based on calculation of a distance weighted average of a block of sixteen pixels from the original image which surround the new output pixel location. As with bilinear interpolation, this method results in completely new pixel values. However, the last two methods both produce images which have a much sharper appearance and avoid the blocky appearance of the nearest neighbour method.

Map scale can be defined as the ratio between the distance on a printed map and the distance of the same stretch in the terrain.\r\n\r\nA 1:50,000 scale map means that 1 cm on the map represents 50,000 cm (i.e. 500 m) in the terrain. “Large-scale” means that the ratio is relatively large, so typically it means there is much detail to see, as on a 1:1000 printed map. “Small-scale”, in contrast, means a small ratio, hence less detail, as on a 1:2,500,000 printed map.\r\nDigital spatial data, as stored in a GIS, are essentially without scale: scale is a ratio notion associated with visual output, such as a map or on-screen display, not with the data that was used to produce the map or display. When digital spatial data sets have been collected with a specific map-making purpose in mind, and all maps have been designed to use one single map scale, for instance 1:25,000, we may assume that the data carries the characteristic of “a 1:25,000 digital data set.”\r\n\r\nThere is a relationship between the effectiveness of a map for a given purpose and the map’s scale. The Public Works department of a city council cannot use a 1:250,000 map for replacing broken sewer pipes, and the map of Figure 1 cannot be reproduced at scale 1:10,000.\r\n\r\nMaps that show much detail of a small area are called large-scale maps. Scale indications on maps can be given verbally, such as “one-inch-to the- mile”, or as a representative fraction like 1:200,000,000 (1 cm on the map equals 200,000,000 cm (or 2000 km) in reality), or by a graphic representation such as the scale bar. The advantage of using scale bars in digital environments is that its length also changes when the map is zoomed in, or enlarged, before printing. Sometimes it is necessary to convert maps from one scale to another, which may lead to problems of cartographic generalization.\r\n\r\nSpatial and temporal scales can not only be attached to processes, but also to observations. An example is given below, which summarizes the spatial and temporal scales of a few well-known Earth observation systems.\r\n\r\nScales of RS observations\r\nSensor              Spatial scale\t  Temporal scale\r\nMeteosat\t  Hemisphere\t  15 minutes\r\nNOAA-AVHRR\t  3000 km\t  daily\r\nLandsat TM\t  180 km\t          16 days\r\nSpot\t          60 km\t          26 days (pointable)",

            "description": "Classification is a technique for purposely removing detail from an input data set in the hope of revealing important patterns (of spatial distribution). In the process, we produce an output data set, so that the input set can be left intact. This output set is produced by assigning a characteristic value to each element in the input set, which is usually a collection of spatial features that could be raster cells or points, lines or polygons. If the number of characteristic values in the output set is small in comparison to the size of the input set, we have classified the input set.\r\n\r\nThe input data set may, itself, have been the result of a classification. In such cases we refer to the output data set as a reclassification. For example, we may have a soil map that shows different soil type units and we would like to show the suitability of units for a specific crop. In this case, it is better to assign to the soil units an attribute of suitability for the crop. Since different soil types may have the same crop suitability, a classification may merge soil units of different type into the same category of crop suitability.\r\n\r\nIn classification of vector data, there are two possible results. In the first, the input features may become the output features in a new data layer, with an additional category assigned. In other words, nothing changes with respect to the spatial extents of the original features. Figure a of Examples illustrates this first type of output. A second type of output is obtained when adjacent features of the same category are merged into one bigger feature. Such a post-processing function is called spatial merging, aggregation or dissolving. An illustration of this second type is found in Figure b of Examples. Observe that this type of merging is only an option in vector data, as merging cells in an output raster on the basis of a classification makes little sense. Vector data classification can be performed on point sets, line sets or polygon sets; the optional merge phase only makes sense for lines and polygons.\r\n\r\nUser-controlled classifications require a classification table or user interaction. GIS software can also perform automatic classification, in which a user only specifies the number of classes in the output data set. The system automatically determines the class break points. The two main techniques of determining break points being used are the equal interval technique and the equal frequency technique.\r\n\r\nEqual Interval Technique\r\nThe minimum and maximum values vmin and vmax of the classification parameter are determined and the (constant) interval size for each category is calculated as (vmax - vmin) ∕ n, where n is the number of classes chosen by the user. This classification is useful in that it reveals the distribution pattern, as it determines the number of features in each category.\r\n\r\nEqual Frequency Technique\r\nThis technique is also known as quantile classification. The objective is to create categories with roughly equal numbers of features per category. The total number of features is determined first, then, based on the required number of categories, the number of features per category is calculated. The class break points are then determined by counting off the features in order of classification parameter value.",

Not only in everyday situations, but also in formalized thought, it is necessary to be able to deal with concepts that are not necessarily true or false, but that operate somewhere in between. Since its original development by Zadeh (1965), there has been considerable discussion of fuzzy, or continuous, set theory as an approach for handling imprecise spatial data. In GIS, fuzzy set theory appears to have two particular benefits: the ability to handle logical modelling (map overlay) operations on inexact data; and the possibility of using a variety of natural language expressions to qualify uncertainty.

Other techniques of selecting features can also usually be combined. Any set of selected features can be used as the input for a subsequent selection procedure. This means, for instance, that we can select all medical clinics first, then identify roads within 200 m of them, then select from those only the major roads, then select the nearest clinics to these remaining roads as the ones that should receive our financial support for maintenance. In this way, we are combining various techniques of selection.\r\n\r\nInteractive Spatial Selection\r\nIn interactive spatial selection, one defines the selection condition by pointing at or drawing spatial objects on the screen display, after having indicated the spatial data layer(s) from which to select features.

After all, objects are identified by the parameters of location, shape, size and orientation, and many of these parameters can be expressed in terms of vectors.

These features are called simplices as they are the simplest geometric shapes of some dimension: point (0-simplex), line segment (1-simplex), triangle (2-simplex), and tetrahedron (3-simplex). When we combine various simplices into a single feature, we obtain a simplicial complex. When area objects are stored using a vector approach, the usual technique is to apply a boundary model.

This results in an application-determined (i.e. adaptive) partition of space. If the object has a fuzzy boundary, a polygon is an even worse approximation, even though potentially it may be the only one possible. Clearly, we expect additional data to accompany the area data. Such information could be stored in database tables.\r\n\r\nA simple but naïve representation of area features would be to list for each polygon the list of lines that describes its boundary. Each line in the list would, as before, be a sequence that starts with a node and ends with one, possibly with vertices in between. As the same line makes up the boundary from the two polygons, this line would be stored twice in the above representation, namely once for each polygon. This is a form of data duplication—known as data redundancy—which is (at least in theory) unnecessary, although it remains a feature of some systems. Another disadvantage of such polygon-by-polygon representations is that if we want to identify the polygons that border the bottom left polygon, we have to do a complicated and time-consuming search analysis comparing the vertex lists of all boundary lines with that of the bottom left polygon.

It takes the vector representation (point, line, or polygon) of a real-world feature, and then creates a buffer zone based on a defined distance from the feature’s border. Thus, the created buffer zone is an area whose boundary always has the same distance to the input vector feature, e.g. the buffer zone for a point feature is a circle. Real-world examples for buffer zones could be protected areas along rivers or around nature conservation areas, or represent a simple proximity analysis. In the latter case, the buffer analysis is usually the first step of the analysis, followed by an overlay of the buffer zone with the target features to find those target features within the buffer zone, and thus within a certain distance of the original feature. Usually, the buffer zone extends outwards from the feature, but polygons can also have inner buffer zones. If the buffer zones from multiple features overlap, the analyst can decide to leave the individual boundaries of the buffer zones intact, or to dissolve them, i.e. merging the overlapping buffer zones into one larger buffer zone. The size of the buffer zone, i.e. the distance of its boundary from the original feature’s boundary, can be based on an uniform numerical value and associated spatial unit, but often, it is based on an attribute value (numerical or class) of the feature. Conceptually, buffering using raster representations of real-world features is similar a proximity analysis with a regular grid of square polygons: Departing from raster cells that form the area to be buffered, all raster cells that fall within the designated distance (overlay) from the buffer zone.

If either of these requirements is not met, the use of an overlay operator is pointless. The principle of spatial overlay is to compare the characteristics of the same location in both data layers and to produce a result for each location in the output data layer. The specific result to produce is determined by the user. It might involve a calculation or some other logical function to be applied to every area or location. With raster data, as we shall see, these comparisons are carried out between pairs of cells, one from each input raster. With vector data, the same principle of comparing locations applies but the underlying computations rely on determining the spatial intersections of features from each input layer.\r\n\r\nVector overlay operators are useful but geometrically complicated, and this sometimes results in poor operator performance.

To obtain characteristics from an eventually-to-be identified neighbourhood, the same techniques apply. So what remains to be discussed here is the proper determination of a neighbourhood.

Other arithmetic operators may include modulo division (MOD) and integer division (DIV). Modulo division returns the remainder of division: for instance, 10 MOD 3 will return 1 as 10 - 3 × 3 = 1. Similarly, 10 DIV 3 will return 3.\r\n\r\nOther operators are goniometric: sine (sin), cosine (cos), tangent (tan); and their inverse functions asin, acos, and atan, which return radian angles as real values.  The assignment\r\n\r\nC1 := A + 10\r\n\r\nwill add a constant factor of 10 to all cell values of raster A and store the result as output raster C1. The assignment\r\n\r\nC2 := A + B\r\n\r\nwill add the values of A and B cell by cell, and store the result as raster C2. Finally, the assignment\r\n\r\nC3 := (A - B) ∕ (A + B) × 100\r\n\r\nwill create output raster C3, as the result of the subtraction (cell by cell, as usual) of B cell values from A cell values, divided by their sum. The result is multiplied by 100. This expression, when carried out on AVHRR channel 1 (red) and AVHRR channel 2 (near infrared) of NOAA satellite imagery, is known as the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). It has proven to be a good indicator of the presence of green vegetation.\r\n\r\nComparison and logical operators\r\n\r\nMap algebra also allows the comparison of rasters cell by cell. To this end, we may use the standard comparison operators (<, ⇐, =, >=, > and <>).\r\n\r\nA simple raster comparison assignment is\r\n\r\nC := A <> B.\r\n\r\nIt will store truth values—either true or false—in the output raster C. A cell value in C will be true if the cell’s value in A differs from that cell’s value in B. It will be false if they are the same. Logical connectives are also supported in many raster calculi. We have already seen the connectives of AND , OR and NOT in raster overlay operators. Another connective that is commonly offered in map algebra is exclusive OR (XOR). The expression a XOR b is true only if either a or b is true, but not both.\r\n\r\nConditional expressions\r\nThe comparison and logical operators produce rasters with the truth values true and false. In practice, we often need a conditional expression together with them that allows us to test whether a condition is fulfilled. The general format is:\r\n\r\nOutput raster := CON(condition, then expression, else expression).\r\n\r\nHere, condition stands for the condition tested, then the expression is evaluated if condition holds, and else the expression is evaluated if it does not hold. This means that an expression such as CON(A = “forest”, 10, 0) will evaluate to 10 for each cell in the output raster where the same cell in A is classified as forest. For each cell where this is not true, the else expression is evaluated, resulting in 0.\r\n\r\nOverlays using a decision table\r\nConditional expressions are powerful tools in cases where multiple criteria must be taken into account. A small example may illustrate this. Consider a suitability study in which a land use classification and a geological classification must be used.  Domain expertise dictates that some combinations of land use and geology result in suitable areas, whereas other combinations do not. In our example, forests on alluvial terrain and grassland on shale are considered suitable combinations, while any others are not.\r\n\r\nWe could produce an output raster with a map algebra expression, such as\r\n\r\nSuitability := CON((Landuse = “Forest” AND Geology = “Alluvial”)\r\nOR (Landuse = “Grass” AND Geology = “Shale”),\r\n“Suitable”, “Unsuitable”)\r\n\r\nand consider ourselves lucky that there are only two “suitable” cases. In practice, many more cases must usually be covered and, then, writing up a complex CON expression is not an easy task.\r\n\r\nTo this end, some GISs accommodate setting up a separate decision table that will guide the raster overlay process. This extra table carries domain expertise and dictates which combinations of input raster-cell values will produce which output raster-cell value. This gives us a raster overlay operator using a decision table. The GIS will have supporting functions to generate the additional table from the input rasters and to enter appropriate values in the table.",

            "description": "Spatial cluster analysis is the grouping of similar spatial objects into classes (clusters) in such a way that the objects within the cluster are highly similar compared to the objects outside of the cluster. Spatial clustering forms an important part of spatial data mining (Han et al., 2001; Miller et al., 2009). A wealth of spatial clustering tools are currently available with immense application potential.  \r\n\r\nIn earth observation studies, spatial cluster techniques are often applied to identify zones with similar land covers by using earth observation data as input. An example of such a technique is the K-means classifier (Han et al., 2001; Miller et al., 2009). This unsupervised classification technique makes several clusters (e.g. land use classes) of which each pixel is assigned to the cluster with the nearest mean (Han et al., 2001). The amount of clusters can be freely defined by the user just as the input metrics to perform the classification.  A drawback of the K-means classifier is the need to specify the amount of output clusters. Density Based Spatial Clustering (DBSC) overcomes this issue since it automatically defines the optimal amount of clusters (Miller et al., 2009). In this type of clustering technique, dense regions of objects (proximate objects) are clustered and separated from regions with low density (noise) (Han et al., 2001; Liu et al., 2012). Finally, another frequently applied spatial clustering technique is the hierarchical agglomerative clustering. This technique makes use of a dendrogram to decompose the data into clusters. The agglomerative approach is a bottom-up approach in which all objects are first grouped in a distinct cluster and while moving upward in the tree, pairs of clusters are merged based on some metrics (e.g. spatial proximity) (Han et al., 2001). \r\n\r\nSpatial cluster techniques have many advantages when dealing with big datasets which is often the case when working with earth observation data. Its simplicity to use and the fast increase of cloud computing power makes from it powerful techniques to extract spatial patterns out of the data. It allows to translate raw earth observation data into a more user-friendly data product by showing the spatial patterns of the data.",

Applications of these techniques using terrain data include overland transport, flow, and siting tasks, but similar analyses can be conducted using non-tangible surfaces such as those of temperature, pressure and population density.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous examples that require more advanced computations on continuous field representations, such as:\r\n\r\nSlope angle calculation - the calculation of the slope steepness, expressed as an angle in degrees or percentages, for any or all locations.\r\n\r\nCalculating slope aspect - the calculation of the aspect (or orientation) of the slope in degrees (between 0 and 360∘), for any or all locations.\r\n\r\nSlope convexity/concavity calculation - defined as the change of the slope (negative when the slope is concave and positive when the slope is convex)—can be calculated as the second derivative of the field.\r\n\r\nSlope length calculation - with the use of neighbourhood operations, it is possible to calculate for each cell the nearest distance to a watershed boundary (the upslope length) and to the nearest stream (the downslope length). This information is useful for hydrological modelling.\r\n\r\nHillshading is used to portray relief difference and terrain morphology of hilly and mountainous areas. The application of a special filter to a DEM produces hillshading. The colour tones in a hillshading raster represent the amount of reflected light at each location, depending on its orientation relative to the illumination source. This illumination source is usually chosen to be to the northwest at an angle of 45∘ above the horizon.\r\n\r\nThree-dimensional map display - with GIS software, three-dimensional views of a DEM can be constructed in which the location of the viewer, the angle under which he or she is looking, the zoom angle, and the amplification factor of relief exaggeration can be specified. Three-dimensional views can be constructed using only a predefined mesh, covering the surface, or using other rasters (e.g. a hillshading raster) or images (e.g. satellite images) that are draped over the DEM.\r\n\r\nDetermination of change in elevation through time - the cut-and-fill volume of soil to be removed or to be brought in to make a site ready for construction can be computed by overlaying the DEM of the site before the work begins with the DEM of the expected modified topography. It is also possible to determine landslide effects by comparing DEMs of before and after a landslide event.\r\n\r\nAutomatic catchment delineation - catchment boundaries or drainage lines can be automatically generated from a good quality DEM with the use of neighbourhood functions. The system will determine the lowest point in the DEM, which is considered to be the outlet of the catchment. From there, it will repeatedly search for the neighbouring pixels with the highest altitude. This process is repeated until the highest location (i.e. the cell with the highest value) is found; the path followed determines the catchment boundary. For delineating the drainage network, the process is reversed. Then the system will work from the watershed downwards, each time looking for the lowest neighbouring cells, which determines the direction of water flow (Flow Computation).\r\n\r\nDynamic modelling - apart from the applications mentioned above, DEMs are increasingly used in GIS-based dynamic modelling, such as the computation of surface run-off and erosion, groundwater flow, the delineation of areas affected by pollution, the computation of areas that will be covered by processes such as flows of debris and lava. An example is (Diffusion).\r\n\r\nVisibility analysis - a viewshed is the area that can be “seen” (i.e. it is in the direct line-of-sight) from a specified target location. Visibility analysis can determine the area visible from a scenic lookout or the area that can be reached by a radar antenna, as well as assess how effectively a road or quarry will be hidden from view.",

            "description": "Geostatistics are a variety of techniques used to analyze continuous data e.g., rainfall, elevation, air pollution. The fundamental structure of geostatistics is based on the concept of semi-variograms and their use for spatial prediction kriging. Sampling methods are also discussed in Unit GD9 Field data collection. \r\nGeostatistics is a subdiscipline of spatial statistics developed to estimate the value of a continuous spatial process at unknown locations by using the information of the value of these process at known locations. Furthermore, it aims to quantify the uncertainty related to the prediction (Calder et al., 2009; Emmanouil, 2019). In order to do such predictions, geostatistics entails some statistical methods which use as starting point the assumption of a random component that can define the spatiotemporal variability. These methods are developed to infer the parameters that can describe the spatiotemporal patterns of the input variables (e.g. soil moisture) so that finally these variables at unsampled locations can be estimated (interpolated) (Emmanouil, 2019). Geostatistical methods are strongly related with classic interpolation methods but differ by its use of random variables that allow to given an uncertainty indication associated with the prediction of variables in space and time. \r\n\r\nIn environmental research geostatistical techniques are often applied to infer (interpolate) variables at such unobserved locations by using information from known locations. One of such geostatistical techniques is Kriging, which is a geostatistical method that predicts variables by using spatial interpolation. This spatial interpolation is done by establishing a semivariogram that defines the spatial relationship between the variables of interest in function of the distance. Because of this, the Kriging technique can also give an indication on the variance or accuracy of the prediction (Calder et al., 2009); Van der Meer, 2012). On the other hand, cokriging is another important geostatistical technique and differs from Kriging by using the cross-correlation between variables to generate local estimates (Van der Meer, 2012). In earth observation studies, cokriging can be applied to better predict sparsely based data on the ground (e.g. biomass) by using the cross-correlation of this variable with a more continuously sampled satellite metric like NDVI. Furthermore, these techniques can also be used to enhance satellite image information, filling missing pixels or even downscale the information to a higher resolution (Van der Meer, 2012).",

The aim of this knowledge area is to recognize, identify, and appreciate the explicit spatial, spatio-temporal and semantic components of the geographic environment at an ontological and epistemological level in preparation for modeling the environment with geographic data and analysis. To do this, one must understand the nature of space and time as a context for geographic phenomena.This knowledge area covers the ways in which views of the geographic environment depend on philosophical viewpoints, physics, human cognition, society, and the task at hand. This knowledge area also requires an understanding of the fundamental principles in the discipline of geography, the \"language\" of spatial tasks. On a more advanced level, this area incorporates mathematical and graphical models that formalize these concepts, such as set theory, algebra, and semantic nets. Because of its wide range of foundational principles, this knowledge area forms a basis for the other knowledge areas. Wise design and use of geospatial technologies requires an understanding of the nature of geographic information, the social and philosophical context of geographic information, and the principles of geography. This knowledge area is especially closely tied to Knowledge Areas Data Modeling (DM) and Design Aspects (DA), as generic data models and application designs need to be grounded in sound conceptual models. The foundations of geographic information have developed over several decades. Philosophical and scientific views on the nature of space and time have evolved since the ancient Greeks. Early papers during the Quantitative Revolution, such as Berry (1964), began to formalize the structure of information used in geographic inquiry.The fundamental data structures and algorithms comprising the GIS software developed in the 1960`s and 1970`s were based on implicit \"common-sense\" conceptual models of geographic information. During the 1980`s, several researchers questioned these underlying assumptions. Some were refuted, other confirmed, and many extended. However, the most rapid pace of development in this area was during the 1990`s with the rise of GIScience as a distinct discipline, and the many cooperative initiatives it comprised.The new millennium has seen some of these foundational principles incorporated into commercial software, thus making theoretical knowledge even more important for practitioners. It is expected that the concepts in this knowledge area will be learned gradually. An introductory course may cover only a few topics in a cursory manner, an intermediate course on data modeling or data analysis may consider several theoretical topics of practical application, and a number of graduate courses could cover each topic in a research-oriented environment. Discussion of this knowledge area includes several terms that can have multiple meanings. For the purposes of this document, two in particular require definition: Geographic: Almost any subject or discourse involving earthly phenomena, studied from a spatial perspective at a medium scale (sub-astronomical and super-architectural). Phenomenon: Any subject of geographic discourse that is perceived to be external to the individual, including entities, events, processes, social constructs, and the like.",

Euclidean space can be informally defined as a model of space in which locations are represented by coordinates—(x, y) in 2D and (x, y, z) in 3D space—and distance and direction can defined with geometric formulas. In 2D, this is known as the Euclidean plane. To represent relevant aspects of real-world phenomena inside a GIS, we first need to define what it is we are referring to. We might define a geographic phenomenon as a manifestation of an entity or process of interest that:\r\n\r\nitem can be named or described;\r\nitem can be georeferenced; and\r\nitem can be assigned a time (interval) at which it is/was present.\r\n\r\nRelevance of phenomena for the use of a GIS depends entirely on the objectives of the study at hand. For instance, in water management, relevant objects can be river basins, agro-ecological units, measurements of actual evapotranspiration, meteorological data, ground\\-water levels, irrigation levels, water budgets and measurements of total water use. All of these can be named or described, georeferenced and provided with a time interval at which each exists. In multipurpose cadastral administration, the objects of study are different: houses, land parcels, streets of various types, land use forms, sewage canals and other forms of urban infrastructure may all play a role. Again, these can be named or described, georeferenced and assigned a time interval of existence.\r\n\r\nNot all relevant information about phenomena has the form of a triplet (description, georeference, time interval). If the georeference is missing, then the object is not positioned in space: an example of this would be a legal document in a cadastral system. It is obviously somewhere, but its position in space is not considered relevant. If the time interval is missing, we might have a phenomenon of interest that exists permanently, i.e.\\ the time interval is infinite. If the description is missing, then we have something that exists in space and time, yet cannot be described. Obviously this last issue limits the usefulness of the information.\r\n\r\nTypes of geographic phenomena\r\nThe definition of geographic phenomena attempted above is necessarily abstract and is, therefore, perhaps somewhat difficult to grasp. The main reason is that geographic phenomena come in different “flavours”. Before categorizing such flavours, there are two further observations to be made.\r\n\r\nFirst, to represent a phenomenon in a GIS requires us to state what it is and where it is. We must provide a description—or at least a name—on the one hand, and a georeference on the other hand. We will ignore temporal issues for the moment and come back to these in Temporal dimension and Spatial-temporal data model, the reason being that current GISs do not provide much automatic support for time-dependent data. This topic must, therefore, be considered as an example of advanced GIS use. Second, some phenomena are manifest throughout a study area, while others only occur in specific localities.

Discrete time is composed of discrete elements (seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, or years). For continuous time, no such discrete elements exist: for any two moments in time there is always another moment in between. We can also structure time by events (moments) or periods (intervals). When we represent intervals by a start and an end event, we can derive temporal relationships between events and periods, such as “before”, “overlap”, and “after”.\r\n\r\nValid time and transaction time: Valid time (or world time) is the time when an event really happened, or a string of events took place. Transaction time (or database time) is the time when the event was stored in the database or GIS. Note that the time at which we store something in a database is typically (much) later than when the related event took place.\r\n\r\nLinear, branching and cyclic time: Time can be considered to be linear, extending from the past to the present (‘now’), and into the future. This view gives a single time line. For some types of temporal analysis, branching time - in which different time lines from a certain point in time onwards are possible - and cyclic time - in which repeating cycles such as seasons or days of the week are recognized - make more sense and can be useful.\r\n\r\nTime granularity: When measuring time, we speak of granularity as the precision of a time value in a GIS or database (e.g. year, month, day, second). Different applications may obviously require different granularity. In cadastral applications, time granularity might well be a day, as the law requires deeds to be date-marked; in geological mapping applications, time granularity is more likely to be in the order of thousands or millions of years.\r\n\r\nAbsolute and relative time: Time can be represented as absolute or relative. Absolute time marks a point on the time line where events happen (e.g. “6 July 1999 at 11:15 p.m.”). Relative time is indicated relative to other points in time (e.g. “yesterday”, “last year”, “tomorrow”, which are all relative to “now”, or “two weeks later”, which is relative to some other arbitrary point in time.).",

            "description": "The way we represent relevant components of the real world in our models determines the kinds of questions we can or cannot answer. Besides representing an object or field in 2D or 3D space, the temporal dimension is of a continuous nature. Therefore, in order to represent it in a GIS we have to discretize the time dimension.\r\n\r\nSpatio-temporal data models are ways of organizing representations of space and time in a GIS. Several representation techniques have been proposed in the literature. Perhaps the most common of these is the “snapshot state”, which represents a single moment in time of an ongoing natural or man-made process. We may store a series of these “snapshot states” to represent “change”, but we must be aware that this is by no means a comprehensive representation of that process. \r\n\r\nIn spatio-temporal analysis we consider changes of spatial and thematic attributes over time. We can keep the spatial domain fixed and look only at the attribute changes over time for a given location in space. We might be interested how land cover has changed for a given location or how land use has changed for a given land parcel over time, provided its boundary has not changed. On the other hand, we can keep the attribute domain fixed and consider the spatial changes over time for a given thematic attribute. In this case, we might want to identify locations that were covered by forest over a given period of time.\r\n\r\nFinally, we can assume both the spatial and attribute domains are variable and consider how fields or objects have changed over time. This may lead to notions of object motion - a subject receiving increasing attention in the literature. Applications of moving object research include traffic control, mobile telephony, wildlife tracking, vector-borne disease control and weather forecasting. In these types of applications, the problem of object identity becomes apparent. When does a change or movement cause an object to disappear and become something new? With wildlife this is quite obvious; with weather systems less so. But this should no longer be a surprise: we have already seen that some geographic phenomena can be nicely described as objects, while others are better represented as fields.\r\n\r\nMapping time means mapping change. This may be change in a feature’s geometry, in its attributes, or both. Examples of changing geometry are the evolving coastline of the Netherlands, the location of Europe’s national boundaries, or the position of weather fronts. Changes in the ownership of a land parcel, in land use or in road traffic intensity are other examples of changing attributes. Urban growth is a combination of both: urban boundaries expand with growth and simultaneously land use shifts from rural to urban. If maps are to represent events like these, they should be suggestive of such change.\r\n\r\nThree temporal cartographic techniques can be distinguished:\r\n\r\nSingle Static Map\r\n\r\nSpecific graphic variables and symbols are used to indicate change or represent an event. We can apply the visual variable “value” to represent for example the age of built-up areas.\r\n\r\nSeries of Static Maps\r\n\r\nA single map in the series represents a “snapshot” in time. Together, the maps depict a process of change. Change is perceived by the succession of individual maps depicting the situation in successive snapshots. It could be said that the temporal sequence is represented by a spatial sequence that the user has to follow to perceive the temporal variation. The number of images should be limited since it is difficult for the human eye to follow long series of maps.\r\n\r\nAnimated Maps\r\n\r\nChange is perceived to evolve in a single image by displaying several snapshots one after the other, just like a video clip of successive frames. The difference from the series of maps is that the variation can be deduced from real “change” seen taking place in the image itself, not from a spatial sequence. For the user of a cartographic animation, it is important to have tools available that allow for interaction while viewing the animation. Seeing an animation play will often leave users with many questions about what they have seen. And just replaying the animation is not sufficient to answer questions like “What was the position of the northern coastline during the 15th century?” Most of the general software packages for viewing animations already offer facilities such as “pause” (to look at a particular frame) and ‘(fast-)forward’ and ‘(fast-)backward’, or step-by-step display. More options have to be added, such as the possibility to go directly to a certain frame based on a task command like: “Go to 1850”.",

The power of a GIS is dependent on the richness of information contained in the spatial data structures. Vector models are based on points, lines and areas. Raster models are based on grids. Each cell has a value that is used to represent some characteristic of that location. \r\nLayers are used to display geographic datasets in various digital map environment. A layer stores the path to a source dataset and other layer properties, including symbology. You can use multiple layers on one map and specify its properties. Shapefiles represent spatial character of the object in terms of shape, size and spatial arrangement. Shapefile usually comprise three separate and distinct types of files (main files, index files and database tables). Data base files store additional attributed that can be joined to a shapefiles’ feature. Attribute data types supplement geographic spatial feature with additional information. Spatial data includes information of location and attribute data includes information about other characteristics (what, where and why). A legend is a visual presentation of the symbols that are used on the map with some additional explanations. It includes a sample of each symbol and a short description of the meaning.",

An object is a self-contained part of a scene having certain discriminating properties.\r\n\r\nThe primitives of vector data sets are the point, (poly)line and polygon. Related geometric measurements are location, length, distance and area size. Some of these are geometric properties of a feature in isolation (location, length, area size); others (distance) require two features to be identified.\r\n\r\nIn a GIS, features are represented together with their attributes—geometric and non-geometric—and relationships. The geometry of features is represented with primitives of the respective dimension: a windmill probably as a point; an agricultural field as a polygon. The primitives follow either the vector or the raster approach.\r\n\r\nVector data types describe an object through its boundary, thus dividing the space into parts that are occupied by the respective objects. The raster approach subdivides space into (regular) cells, mostly as a square tessellation of two or three dimensions. These cells are called pixels in 2D and voxels in 3D. The data indicate for every cell which real-world feature is covered, provided the cell represents a discrete field. In the case of a continuous field, the cell holds a representative value for that field. The Table below lists advantages and disadvantages of raster and vector representations.\r\n\r\nThe storage of a raster is, in principle, straightforward. It is stored in a file as a long list of values, one for each cell, preceded by a small list of extra data (the “file header”), which specifies how to interpret the long list. The order of the cell values in the list can, but need not necessarily, be left to right, top to bottom. This simple encoding scheme is known as row ordering. The header of the raster will typically specify how many rows and columns the raster has, which encoding scheme was used, and what sort of values are stored for each cell.\r\n\r\nData can be of a qualitative or quantitative nature. Qualitative data is also called nominal data, which exists as discrete, named values without a natural order amongst the values. Examples are different languages (e.g. English, Swahili, Dutch), different soil types (e.g. sand, clay, peat) or different land use categories (e.g. arable land, pasture). In the map, qualitative data are classified according to disciplinary insights, such as a soil classification system represented as basic geographic units: homogeneous areas associated with a single soil type, recognizable by the soil classification.\r\n\r\nQuantitative data can be measured, either along an interval or ratio scale. For data measured on an interval scale, the exact distance between values is known, but there is no absolute zero on the scale. Temperature is an example: 40 ◦C is not twice as hot as 20 ◦C, and 0 ◦C is not an absolute zero.\r\n\r\nQuantitative data with a ratio scale do have a known absolute zero. An example is income: someone earning $100 earns twice as much as someone with an income of $50. In order to generate maps, quantitative data are often classified into categories according to some mathematical method.\r\n\r\nIn between qualitative and quantitative data, one can distinguish ordinal data. These data are measured along a relative scale and are as such based on hierarchy. For instance, one knows that a particular value is “more” than another value, such as “warm” versus “cool”. Another example is a hierarchy of road types: “highway”, “main road”, “secondary road” and “track”. The different types of data are summarized in Table.",

Such objects are usually easily distinguished and named, and their position in space is determined by a combination of one or more of the following parameters:\r\n\r\nlocation (where is it?)\r\nshape (what form does it have?)\r\nsize (how big is it?)\r\norientation (in which direction is it facing?).\r\n\r\nHow we want to use the information determines which of these four parameters is required to represent the object. For instance, for geographic objects such as petrol stations all that matters in an in-car navigation system is where they are. Thus, in this particular context, location alone is enough, and shape, size and orientation are irrelevant. For roads, however, some notion of location (where does the road begin and end?), shape (how many lanes does it have?), size (how far can one travel on it?) and orientation (in which direction can one travel on it?) seem to be relevant components of information in the same system.",

Fields can be discrete or continuous.\r\n\r\nIn a continuous field, the underlying function is assumed to be “mathematically smooth”, meaning that the field values along any path through the study area do not change abruptly, but only gradually. Good examples of continuous fields are air temperature, barometric pressure, soil salinity and elevation. A continuous field can even be differentiable, meaning that we can determine a measure of change in the field value per unit of distance anywhere and in any direction. For example, if the field is elevation, this measure would be slope, i.e. the change of elevation per metre distance; if the field is soil salinity, it would be salinity gradient, i.e. the change of salinity per metre distance.\r\n\r\nDiscrete fields divide the study space in mutually exclusive, bounded parts, with all locations in one part having the same field value.

This particular relationship between art and maps entails: “developing an inclusive approach of artistic mapping expressions; facilitating and encouraging interaction between cartographers who work with the Art aspects of cartography and artists who produce cartographic artifacts; and developing conceptual elements about the relationships between art and cartography.” Besides ancient paper maps, a sum of factors led digital maps and geospatial visualization, a matter of interest to artists and designers. Thanks to powerful computing systems and with the advancements reached in computer graphics or image processing, or the rise of information visualisation, new forms of representing and visualising geodata have also appeared. Creation of digital maps are still a two-way relationship since artists have explored maps as a medium for expressing their art, and cartographers have approached art to provide more than just the representation of locations and geographic features with the intention to make maps more attractive to their audiences.",

Historical maps are generally considered valuable documents not just because of their historical value but also because most of them also are artistic representations by themselves. From a cartographical point of view, differentiation between historical maps and actual maps is mainly based on the advances in the history of Cartography, so once one disruptive advance in the map making process appears, maps created with previous techniques (and with some artistic or historical value) are usually considered as historical, such as ancient paper-based maps or old sea maps, for instance. Techniques such as scanning or photography can make ancient maps publicly available by converting hard-copy maps to digital ones. Once an historical map is digitised, the next step is to georeference it, which is the process of specifying and relating points of the digitalised map to actual coordinates in a geographic reference system. Because of its archival value and interest, historical maps are adequately preserved - following specific conditions - by map libraries, map societies or museums. Since digital methods and techniques have been replaced over time by new technological advances, first digitally created maps could be also considered historical, not because of its content, but of the techniques used to produce it.",

A map expresses a claim by the inclusion or exclusion of map elements and how these elements are visually related and/or depicted on the map. So, the world could be modeled through the careful choice of content arranged graphically at a specific scale and in specific formats. Therefore, maps embody and project the interests of their creators. The “new cartographies”  declare that maps are redefined as socially constructed arguments based upon consistent semiotic codes. Nowadays, the rise of costless, powerful and accessible tools for creating maps, put power on the side of individuals or groups of individuals with few organisation (crowdsourced data collection or VGI) capable of representing their world views. In addition, monitoring people, places or nature, for instance, should also be seen as another way to show the increasing power of maps. Surveillance mechanisms for tracking populations used by rulers, or the use of extended technologies like Google Earth by environmental organisations to track the Amazonian forest, constitute two examples of the particular use of maps to exert control over human beings or to press governments for taking specific actions, respectively.",

Maps from pre-historic times provided important locational information – what was where and how to get from place to place.  A map can be a relatively simple iconic device, which can be read and interpreted with only a little training. These graphic representations of the real world could be traced in sand or painted on a cave wall and shared through time. Maps even preceded written language and number systems and are found in some format in most cultures through time as a graphical language. Learning to read this language and interpret it without ambiguity is not as simple as first suggested. This complexity has increased as technology has allowed creation of 3D and 4D interactive maps which allow anyone with internet access the ability to investigate different places, topics and times and produce their own map. Today the ability to read and interpret maps is increasingly important as industry, business and government communicates within their organization and the public using maps. Becoming aware of what a “map” shows depends partly on what the senses can register of the representation as a whole. It also depends on recognition of elements in the representation that are meaningful to the observer in the sense that these elements are credible indicators of spatial features. Based on that recognition, the nature of these elements and their spatial pattern might infer thoughts about historic or ongoing processes. This interpretation will be influenced by the expertise and needs of the observer.",

No matter the workflow type, a workflow is defined in a declarative language, either text-based or visual, and stored in a workflow document to ease sharing and maintenance. In GI systems, a workflow can be seen from distinct perspectives. One of the most well-known GI workflow types is spatial data modelling. A model is specified as a combination of processing tools that manipulate and transform the spatial data required by the model. The  order in which the processing tools, inputs, and outputs are organised in a workflow will determine the results and to what extent the spatial question is addressed. However, workflows in GI systems are not only related to spatial data modelling and transformation. There are cases where certain processes in GI systems should be designed in terms of software and hardware requirements, actors needs, organisational aspects or resource usage and demand. How can people’s work contribute to define the stages of a GI architecture? How much time does a regular user spend working with spatial data? How complex is the process going to be? The definition of this sort of workflows can help, for example, in designing an optimal architecture for a GI system in a particular enterprise configuration. \r\nWhether the workflow defines specific steps to process spatial data or the stages and details to implement an enterprise GI system, having a clear idea over each stage's inputs and outputs helps GI systems to be organised, consistent and reliable.

As a GIS system has a direct influence on the information technology department  (IT), the system design tells the organizacion how the current infrastructure can or must support the planned GIS.  This process builds a set of specific recommendations on hardware and network needs based on the number of projects that depend on the GIS solucion, as well as the projected business needs and user requirements. \r\nGIS architects through the system design process need to take into account and identify several conditions: a) infrastructure requirements, b) the network communication capacity, c) hardware and software procurement requirements and, d) software development and data acquisition needs. \r\nHaving a well-defined and successful GIS deployment is not only a matter of what data or software the organization should acquire.

Data modelling is a crucial issue as it defines the content of a spatial database and usefulness of these content (data) for certain applications. Data Modelling is performed using system neutral languages like UML (or more seldom ER-diagrams). These conceptual models have to be transferred to logical models (i.e. tables of a database). Data is stored in spatial databases which are normally organized in an object relational way. For certain types of data specific databases are used, like triple stores, NoSQL DBs, Array DBs etc. For data modelling quite a number of ISO standards are available for deriving the conceptual model as well as for rules for application schemas, spatial schemas, temporal schemas, Quality principles, encoding, 3D modelling (CityGML) etc. Data models provide the means for formalizing the spatio-temporal conceptualizations. Examples of spatial data model types are discrete (object-based), continuous (location-based), dynamic, and probabilistic. Mastery of the objectives presented in this knowledge area require knowledge and skills presented in the bodies of knowledge of allied fields, including computer science (ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Task Force, 2001) and information systems (Gorgone & Gray, 2000; Gorgone & others, 2002).",

The costs of data acquisition can be tremendous, therefore the data represents an enormous value. This value has to be conserved through a safe long term data storage. Therefore databases and especially relational and object relational databases are crucial. For a proper storage and query of geographic information databases are extended with specific data types and data structures.

In model development, system analysis is a process whereby a real-world system is simplified by dividing it into simpler, more manageable parts. A conceptual model captures the components, variables and interactions of a system, and provides a useful way of thinking about the trade-offs between abstraction and representativeness of real-world phenomena. Taken in isolation, however, the interacting parts of a system fail to explain its dynamics behavior. A conceptual model is then translated into a mathematical model to explain system dynamics and interaction. Mathematical models often take the form of equations,  logical rules or other mathematical mechanisms to represent the interrelations and relationships among the constituted parts of a system. Lastly, a simulation model is the computer-based implementation of mathematical models consisting of interrelated equations and logical rules. When a simulation model runs on a computer, it iteratively recalculates the modelled system state as it changes over time in accordance with the relationships represented by the mathematical relationships that describe the system dynamic. Therefore, developing detailed and dynamic simulation models comes at the cost of generality and interpretability, but it brings us realism and the ability to represent real-world processes in specific contexts. Simulation modelling is often used for prediction, exploration, theory development, or even optimization of conditions to achieve desired outcomes, with the goal of examining how the interconnections and relationships that characterise complex social and environmental systems (e.g. ecosystems, urban systems, social systems, global climate system) produces patterns of behavior over time. Therefore, simulation models are increasingly gaining relevance as scientific mechanisms for several reasons. First, simulation models allow researchers to study systems inaccessible to experimental and observational scientific methods, complementing more conventional approaches to discover or formalize theories about real world systems. Also, aS many real-world systems are nonlinear, simulation modelling has turned into a necessary method to explore and understand better such systems. In addition, the availability of computational science methods and technology, together with a large amount of data available from different sources, have greatly driven the adoption of simulation models in a wide range of scientific disciplines.",

Examples of primary data sources include surveying, remote sensing (including aerial and satellite imaging), the global positioning system (GPS), work logs (e.g., police traffic crash reports), environmental monitoring stations, and field surveys. Secondary geospatial or geospatial-temporal data can be acquired by digitizing and scanning analog maps, as well as from other sources, such as governmental agencies. The legitimacy of geographic information science as a discrete field has been claimed in terms of the unique properties of geospatial data. In a paper in which he coined the term GIScience, Goodchild (1992) identified several such properties, including: 1. Geospatial data represent spatial locations and non-spatial attributes measured at certain times. 2. The Earth`s surface is highly complex in shape and continuous in extent. 3. Geospatial data tend to be spatially autocorrelated. It has long been said that data account for the largest portion of geospatial project costs. While this maxim remains true for many projects, practitioners and their clients now can reasonably expect certain kinds of data to be freely or cheaply available via the World Wide Web. Federal, state, regional, and local government agencies, as well as commercial geospatial data producers, operate clearinghouses that provide access to geospatial data. Although geospatial data are much more abundant now than they were ten years ago, data quality issues persist. Good data are expensive to produce and to maintain. Proprietary interests simultaneously increase the supply of geospatial data and impede data accessibility. Standards for geospatial data and metadata are useful in facilitating effective search, retrieval, evaluation, integration with existing data, and appropriate uses. National and international organizations, such as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO), develop and promulgate such standards. INSPIRE directive (Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community) regulates geospatial data management",

Political, ideological, and personal issues aside, organizations invest in GIS&T when estimated benefits outweigh estimated costs. Evaluating costs and benefits is difficult, however and too often leads to nothing being done. For some individuals and groups, costs are prohibitive even though potential benefits are compelling.

Legal regimes determine who can claim the exclusive right to hold and use geospatial data, the conditions under which others may have access to the data, and what subsequent uses are permitted.

Open data requires datasets to be either in the public domain, or distributed through an open license. The data must be provided as a whole, free of charge, and preferably downloadable via the Internet, including any additional information that might be  necessary to comply with the open license’s terms. Openness requires the data to be provided in a readily machine-readable form.

The Open Definition speaks broadly of open ‘works’, rather than of open data. Focusing on data tout court, one can move from the Open Government Data (OGD) principles. According to the OGD principles, which are arguably foundational in understanding the concept of open data, data must be: Complete;  Primary; Timely; Accessible; Machine-processable; Non-discriminatory; Non-proprietary; and License-free. Compliance with the OGD principles needs to be demonstrable, i.e. there need to be accountability measures in place to allow the review of the adherence to the principles above.

Legal relations between public and private organizations and individuals govern data access. The nature of information in general, and the characteristics of geospatial information in particular, make it an unusual and difficult subject for a legal regime that seeks to establish and enforce the type of exclusive control associated with other commodities. Geospatial information is in many ways unlike the kinds of works that intellectual property rights were intended to protect. Still, organizations can, and do, assert proprietary interests in geospatial information. Perspectives on geospatial information as property vary between the public and private sectors and between different countries.",

A business model is a conceptual tool that contains\r\na set of interrelated elements that allow organizations to create and capture value and generate revenues. The development and implementation of an appropriate business model are considered to be a key to the success of the organization and a crucial source for value creation. \r\n\r\nAlthough business models determine how organizations create, deliver, and capture value, they should not be regarded as permanent and invariable structures or settings. Business models are shaped by both internal and external forces, and will only be successful if they are able to adapt to a changing environment. In the GI domain, several technological, regulatory, and societal developments have challenged the existing business models and opened up opportunities for new business models. Among these developments are the establishment of spatial data infrastructures (SDIs) worldwide, the democratization of geographic knowledge, and the move toward open source, open standards, and open data.\r\n\r\nSince the development and implementation of SDIs in different parts of the world, much attention has been paid to the need to find appropriate business models for GI, and in particular, for geographic data providers in the public sector. Traditional business models in which public data providers were selling their data to customers in the private industry and other public agencies were questioned, because they restricted the opportunity for data sharing. The concept of SDI is about moving to new business models, where partnerships between GI organizations are promoted to allow access to a much wider scope of geographic data and services. A key challenge in the development of these SDIs was the alignment of different existing business models of the actors in the GI domain. Moreover, the development and implementation of SDIs also led to the emergence of new business models, which was even more the case with the more recent move toward open geographic data.\r\n\r\nOrganizations can be active in different parts of the geo-information value chain, and can create and offer value in many different ways. As a result, many different GI business models exist. Data providers, data enablers, and data end users could be seen as three main categories of GI business models. Each of these categories consists of many different business models, as different value propositions\r\nwill exist, and value can be created and captured in several ways.",

            "description": "To provide a better insight into the process of adding value to GI, several authors have introduced and applied the information value chain approach. A value chain can be defined as the set of value-adding activities that one or more organizations perform in creating and distributing goods and services. The value chain concept originally was developed for the manufacturing sector, as a tool to evaluate the competitive advantage of firms. More recently, the value chain concept has been applied to other sectors, including information technology where the good or service, and the benefits it provides, is less tangible in nature. A value chain involves the progress of goods from raw materials to finished products through a number of stages, during each of which a new value is added to the original input by various activities. The value chain concept was extended into the information market, with the information value chain referring to the set of activities adding value to information and turning raw data into new information products or services. Especially important in this context is the role of information and communication technologies (ICT), which have an impact on all activities in the information value chain, such as information collection, processing, dissemination, and use. In the context of GI, the value chain relates to the series of value- adding activities to transform raw geographic data into new products that are used by certain end users. Although there are slightly different descriptions of the various steps of the GI value chain, in general, the essential steps in the value chain are: acquisition of raw data, the application of a data model, quality control, and integration with other sources, presentation, and distribution. In recent years, particular attention has been paid to different steps between the process of distributing data and the actual end use of an end product of GI. In addition, after the publication of the data, value can be added to the data in many different ways. Value can be added by making data from different sources easily accessible through repositories and data portals, by building and selling tailored solutions using the data to end users or by using geographic data to improve existing products and services delivered to an end user. In certain cases, this end product will be the first step of a next value chain.",

GIS was accused of being shaped by positivist and masculinist epistemologies, especially due to its emphasis on vision as the principal way of knowing. In addition, feminist critiques claimed that GIS was largely incompatible with positionality and reflexivity, two core concepts of feminist theory. Feminist critiques of GIS also discussed power issues embedded in GIS practices, including the predominance of men in the early days of the GIS industry and the development of GIS practices for the military and surveillance purposes.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, feminist geographers reexamined those critiques and argued against an inherent epistemological incompatibility between GIS methods and feminist scholarship. They advocated for a reappropriation of GIS by feminist scholars in the form of critical feminist GIS practices. The critical GIS perspective promotes an unorthodox, reconstructed, and emancipatory set of GIS practices by critiquing dominant approaches of knowledge production, implementing GIS in critically informed progressive social research, and developing postpositivist techniques of GIS.

In traditional remote sensing workflows, this step follows the image acquisition process. There are two main components, i.e. (1) image processing, (2) analysis, which emphasizes the sequential nature of the process – while increasingly this dichotomy disappears.\r\nThe information production workflow aims at converting semantically rich, but unstructured image data into a set of classes, objects, arrangements, etc., to enable ultimately a complete image understanding and scene reconstruction. This scene reconstruction entails a mental component (“understanding”) and a technical one, by providing standardized classification results or even beyond, dedicated information products in form of digital maps and reports, tailored to the specific application domains and use cases, in order to make informed decisions. Such information products can be maps, reports, dashboards etc., overall it is the transformation from quantitative, semi-continuous digital numbers (“brightness”) to qualitative information using categories and figures, which can be stored and further used in a GIS environment. \r\nThe first part of the process entails image calibration, image correction (geometric, radiometric), data assimilation, and any type of enhancement (contrast manipulation, filtering, etc.) which aims to better condition the information extraction part. It ends where we achieve a significant milestone in the processing milestone, remarkably denoted as analysis-ready data (ARD). From there, we enter into the analysis realm, classically referred to as digital image classification, the process of assigning pixels to classes. In other words, the aggregation of pixel values according to their similarity into categorical (nominal) classes. The discrimination of these classes by and large depend on application domain, and ideally, these classes match with information classes. To address the issue of ambiguity and to overcome the so-called semantic gap in image interpretation by providing a stepping-stone in the information extraction process, the strategy of pre-classification (semi-concepts) has been introduced in the literature.\r\nToday, boundaries between pre-processing and classification increasingly vanish, through an increasing level of automation in the pre-processing and image correction steps. In addition, new ways of analysis emerge, in particular in large time series, including image data cubes.  Instead of a processing chain, which suggests a linear – and potentially irreversible – cascade of manipulations, the automation of large parts of this part allows us to see the process more reversible and approachable from either side.",

When a camera moves over a surface while taking successive overlapping images, the distances between features on the surface will change from one image to the next. The changes depend on the distance of the feature points to the camera, and thus the surface elevation. This motion parallax can be used to generate an accurate 3D representation of the surface. \r\nThe photogrammetric problem of SfM is similar to stereo vision, but has gained popularity with the advent of inexpensive cameras which have variable internal geometries, unlike metrically stabilized cameras traditionally used in airborne mapping. Even with less accurate or even missing GPS location and orientation metadata, SfM still allows for the creation of (hyper)local DEMs as long as the imagery contains sufficient overlap. Airborne or spaceborne platforms can be used, provided that 2D frame-based cameras are used which can be represented with a pinhole mathematical model. \r\nGenerating a digital elevation model (DEM) from SfM is typically handled automatically using specialized software. Firstly, image correspondences are detected. Feature points are identified in the individual images using local contrast feature detectors. The features extracted from all the images are matched with all the available overlapping images and erroneous matches are filtered out. The process typically results in hundreds or thousands of tie-points per image, which allows for robust matching even with large a priori uncertainties in camera orientation. A bundle adjustment, solving for the 3D coordinates of the feature points, the position and orientation of the camera and its internal characteristics then results in an initial, so-called sparse 3D point cloud. \r\nNext, ground control points (GCPs) can be introduced. These are surface features (naturally present or introduced into the scene)  which can be identified at the pixel level in the images by users. Measured also in the field with an accuracy smaller than the pixel size, they can be used to constrain the bundle adjustment solution to improve georeferencing and camera calibration to an accuracy similar to that of the GCP measurement or the GSD size. \r\nSince this process yields a match only for a small subset of all pixels, an additional step, called dense image matching is added. It starts from the exact position and orientations resulting from the bundle adjustment to rectify the images and overlay two or more images, to compare them row by row and in 16 different directions in a process called semi-global matching (SGM). Matching pixels are identified along these lines, and 3D intersection distances photogrammetrically inferred.

            "description": "Photogrammetry is the science and technology of obtaining spatial measurements and other geometrically reliable derived products from photographs. Basic geometric principles applying both traditional analogue and modern digital procedures are related to the central projection of the image in case of typical cameras and to the dynamic projection mostly in case of push-broom sensors, popular in the satellite photogrammetry. The fundamental principle used by photogrammetry is called triangulation. By taking photographs from at least two different locations, so-called “lines of sight” can be developed from each camera to points in a block on the object. These lines of sight (called rays) are mathematically intersected to produce the 3-dimensional coordinates of the points of interest.\r\nWithin data processing the most important parts of photogrammetric workflow are: (1) image orientation, (2) model reconstruction, and (3) orthorectification. Image orientation is based mostly on aerial triangulation, however recently the computer vision algorithm, called structure from motion, became more popular in particularly in close range photogrammetry. Both orientation approaches include detection or measurement of the points between overlapping images in a block, control points measurements in a field defining orientation in reference system and check points verifying the orientation process. The satellite photogrammetry due to different projection and much bigger areas of imaging is usually related to Rational Polynomial Coefficients (RPCs) defining preliminary scene orientation during image orientation. However, to receive more accurate results also here the control points measured in a field are in use. The second part of the modern photogrammetric processing is 3D model reconstruction. In past, vectorization within the stereoscopic measurements was the most popular way of using photogrammetric data after the image orientation. The development of the informatics contributed to the development of the image matching algorithms that can provide dense image point clouds, which can be used to the 3D detailed modelling including digital elevation model production. The final step of photogrammetric processing is orthorectification, which delivers cartometric image called orthophoto mosaiced into orthophotomaps. This process comprises the influence of digital terrain model, model of camera (interior orientation) and image orientation (exterior orientation). Orthophotomap and elevation models derived from photogrammetric processing are applied as very popular data source in many GIS systems. The other photogrammetric outcomes are, for example a 3D measurement or 3D models of some real-world object or scene.",

Many companies deliver their images together with RPCs and existing software implementations can automatically read these files and apply the RPC transformation on the fly. An accurate elevation model is important to remove the influence of topography (e.g. hills, valley, etc.) on the raw image so that users can accurately compute distances, areas, and directions. Without performing orthorectification, the features in the image are tilted (especially the features located away from the center of the camera). Many satellite data products (e.g. Sentinel images, Landsat data products) are orthorectified using Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data which is a freely available data product and has a spatial resolution of e.g. 1 arc-second (30 m).

This includes requirements to the accuracy of extracted biophysical information. Additionally, the decision and choice of methods depends on the type of remote sensing data available, the amount of in-situ historical and/or concurrent atmospheric information available.\r\nAn atmospheric correction is essential when biophysical or geophysical parameters (e.g. of water or vegetation) are going to be extracted from the remote sensing data. If the data is not corrected, the subtle differences in reflectance among the contributing image bands may be lost. This is especially relevant when biophysical information shall be compared to that of images from other dates.\r\nHowever, some cases exist where it is unnecessary to perform atmospheric correction. For example, it is not necessary for producing an image classification product from a single date of remotely sensed data. If a maximum likelihood classification is applied that uses training data with the same relative scale for the pixel values, then, atmospheric correction has little effect on the classification accuracy. The same holds true for a post-classification change detection where the classifications of the two different dates were performed independently. \r\nThe process of (absolute) atmospheric correction requires a model atmosphere and in situ atmospheric measurements acquired at the time of remote sensor data acquisition as input.

Topographic effects of illumination and shadow are particularly relevant in mountainous regions and in regions towards the higher latitudes of the southern and northern hemisphere. The effects appear pronounced during the winter season. \r\nTogether with sensor calibration and atmospheric correction, topographic correction is part of the radiometric correction process to obtain true reflectance values from sensor radiance. This process is necessary when using EO data for obtaining geophysical measurements. It can also benefit the accuracy of image classifications by reducing the internal variability of vegetation types, since the corrected reflectance relates better to the geometrical or biological properties of the plant than to the original reflectance.\r\nMethods for the removal of topographic effects from remotely sensed images can simply be based on band ratios that do not require additional input. Alternatively, they use digital elevation models (DEMs) as an additional input and apply sophisticated modelling of the illumination conditions.

Additionally, the term “correction” points to the fact that radiometric measurements with satellite sensors contain error. Therefore, radiometric correction is concerned with improving the accuracy of surface spectral reflectance, emittance, or back-scattered measurements obtained using a remote sensing system. The Earth’s atmosphere, land and water are complex and can never be captured perfectly because of the limitations of remote sensing devices that lie in their spatial, spectral temporal and radiometric resolution. Therefore, error occurs in the data acquisition process and degrades the quality of remotely sensed data. The most common errors in remote sensing are radiometric and geometric. This concept is focused on the correction of remote sensing data to account for radiometric error that is to some degree systematic. Systematic errors in radiometric measurements come from the interaction of the sensed radiance with the atmosphere, the acquisition geometry in relation to the radiance source (the sun) and the Earth surface geometry (terrain).\r\nThere are several levels of radiometric calibration and correction. The first is sensor calibration that converts the DNs to top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance. It converts to radiance values and further to reflectance values by accounting for the viewing angle and sun angle during acquisition. The second is atmospheric correction that converts TOA reflectance to bottom-of-atmosphere (BOA) reflectance. The third is topographic correction that converts BOA reflectance to surface reflectance. \r\nRadiometric calibration is necessary to ensure radiometric comparability of the measurements. There is a need for calibration when comparing different spectral bands within one image, e.g. for the calculation of geo-biophysical parameters with band math operations. Results from uncalibrated image data would differ from results achieved with calibrated data because the unaccounted cal_gain and cal_offset of the used spectral bands would lead to distortions. \r\nIn addition, radiometric calibration complements the geospatial comparability that is achieved with geo-referencing an image to geographic coordinates. Geo-referencing enables comparison of an image pixel to the geospatially matching pixel in another image acquired with a different sensor but with comparable resolution. Radiometric calibration enables a radiometric comparison between these two pixels’ radiance values. In case the two images are from different acquisition dates, a calculated radiometric difference would indicate change. This example shows the relevance of radiometric calibration for inter-sensor comparisons.\r\nRadiometric comparability is particularly relevant in studies that require inter-sensor comparisons, comparisons of surface features over time, or comparisons to laboratory or field reflectance data. Then the radiometric correction should cover atmospheric, solar and topographic effects.

In other words, it aims to combine measurements (observations) with the understanding of the spatio-temporal properties and evolution of system’s variables or properties and model information about them. Models can be calibrated and keeping them ‘on track’ by constraining them with observations. Vice versa, observations can be validated through models. Approached as a mathematical problem, data assimilation aims at minimizing cost functions or penalize a function to ensure optimality in fitting. Equations are used to describe system parameters and the relationships among them, It is noteworthy, that models encompass information from previous measurements, experiences, and theory. While the observations are influenced by (known) properties such as precisions, etc. of the measurement devices, the robustness of models rely on the consolidated knowledge. Because uncertainties reside in all components with unknown or even undeterminable errors, the approach is usually probabilistic, including Bayesian and other related techniques.  Widely used in meteorological sciences, successful data assimilation has been boosted the reliability of weather forecast , while sensitivity to errors remains. \r\nIn Earth observation, data assimilation compensates for the fact that a specific site could be observed in a variety of measurements by satellites with different sensor types, at different dates, different angular geometries and viewing directions, illumination conditions (solar time), observation frequencies, etc. In particular, for monitoring processes, measurements over time need to assure to actually measure the status of the system or object and not the divergence in observation. To overcome these divergences and converge them with the actual properties of an observed object or target class such as spectral or geospatial properties, observation modelling can be considered an important contribution from geospatial theory. this also links to class modelling or geon modelling. The synergy of a vegetation growth model and a remote sensing observation model can be exploited to improve the retrieval of geo-biophysical information. For vegetation and crop type monitoring radiative transfer modelling (RTF) is being used as an example. \r\nData assimilation can also serve in bridging the gaps between non-availabilities of EO data and other observations, to provide estimates or prediction for geographical variables, testing of hypotheses or continuous observation (monitoring). A related aspect is data imputation, i.e. filling gaps in observations e.g. by other, complementary data sets (e.g. Radar imagery in the absence of VHR data in cloudy weather conditions). Recently, these sources can also be complemented by crowd mapping and citizen science. \r\nWhen interpretation of data comes into play, such as image classification, we introduce another level of uncertainty. Thus the community seeks for rigorus classifiers based on solid spectral models, acting across sensors. Semantic enrichment of satellite data is a related strategy for reaching to interpreted data in a rigorous way. \r\nSummarizing, data assimilation comprises steps to improve the level of interpretability of the input data, by enrichment (get rid of spatial/temporal gaps), by accounting for heterogeneity (through harmonization), and by integration (combination with other data that is relevant to the application). Thereby, datasets become more comparable to each other.",

The goal is to provide quantitative results directly relating to the biophysical state, but independent of acquisition conditions and technology. Assessment of vegetation status is a key motivation for this, because through plant respiration and photosynthesis, vegetation is critical for modelling terrestrial ecosystems and energy cycles in environmental studies. \r\nImportant parameters describing canopy structure include leaf area index (LAI), green cover fraction (fCover), fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR), plant height, biomass and leaf angle distribution.  At leaf biochemical level, leaf chlorophyll/water,  fuel moisture and leaf pigmentation content are used.\r\nVisual inspection can provide a first assessment of plant status. For detailed measurements of biophysical parameters, mostly destructive methods have been used. Chemical measurement techniques on leaf samples can measure pigment concentrations very accurately, but are time consuming and only use very limited samples.  \r\nMuch more extensive data can be collected using earth observation imagery.  These range from large scale spaceborne observations with high frequency at coarse resolution to dedicated UAV flights which can offer spectral information of  individual plants. Radar and LiDAR acquisitions, which are insensitive to weather conditions, now complement optical observations. \r\nMethods to retrieve the parameters from remote sensing data fall into two main categories. Statistical models empirically match data to a biophysical variable. Univariate techniques use a single quantity derived from the data, usually a vegetation index whereas multivariate techniques link a combination of measurements at different wavelengths to one or more biophysical parameters.\r\nPhysically-based modeling is an alternative approach which uses advanced radiative transfer models to describe the transfer and interaction of radiation inside a leaf or canopy based on robust physical, chemical, and biological processes. They compute the interaction between solar radiation and plants and provide as such a better understanding between biophysical variables and reflectance characteristics. Good examples are Leaf optical models such as PROSPECT and LIBERTY which simulate leaf optical properties by absorption and scattering coefficients. Canopy reflectance models simulate canopy reflectance as a function of a complex description of plant structural and radiometric attributes to develop a quantitative understanding of remote sensing information.",

            "description": "Leaves, when healthy and vigour show a characteristic green colour. This visual effect evident to humans is caused by the co-existence of two evolutionarily facts: the specific interaction of the chlorophyll pigment in living leaves to the visible spectrum (VIS, 400-700 nm wavelength) of light emitted by the sun and the sensitivity of our human eye to the same sub-spectrum. According to fundamental physical laws of radiation (Stefan Boltzmann law of blackbody radiation and Wien’s displacement law), the VIS sub-spectrum corresponds to the radiation maximum of the sun, a hot blackbody with a surface heat of about 6000 K. Living leaves are structured in specific layers exhibiting characteristic interaction with light. The chloroplasts located in the so-called palisade layer, make use of the blue and the red part of sunlight for photosynthesis, the unique process of transforming light to create energy (carbohydrates) from water and carbon dioxide. This leads to the specific behaviour of leaves to absorb large portions (up to 90%) of the blue and red part of the electromagnetic spectrum and reflect nearly 100% of the green light. The peak reflectance in green light makes leaves (and plants in general) appear in green colour in our visual perception. \r\nA second, by no means less characteristic, feature of leaves is the specific response to near infrared (NIR, at around 700 nm wavelength) light in the mesophyll tissue (transmittance, scattering and reflectance). Only a small fraction of NIR is being absorbed. \r\nThis combination of two specific spectral characteristics, the absorption in VIS (red colour) by chlorophyll a in palisade layers, and the reflectance of NIR in the spongy tissue, makes the spectral profiles of plants and vegetation exhibiting a very characteristic shape, the so-called red edge. This absorption edge between red and NIR light is sharper for higher intensity green reflectance and brighter green tones (such as grassland or bright deciduous forest) than for less intensive reflectance and darker tones (coniferous forest). \r\nThe red edge may shift for the same vegetation type due to plant maturity or plant stress. This effect we call the red shift. The red shift is sensitive to crop maturity (headed stage) and may indicate harvesting time. Notably, there is also a blue shift, indicating green plants’ exposure to geochemical stress, which causes the absorption spectra to shift towards shorter wavelengths. \r\nPlants usually do not appear in isolation but form a canopy with a certain degree of coverage (e.g., crown closure in forests), and a certain part of understorey or soil per area unit. The resulting canopy reflectance is therefore a spectral mix of soil and vegetation (or even different types of vegetation) and generally lower than the reflectance of a pure vegetation sample under lab conditions. \r\nTo capture most of these plant-typical spectral characteristics, the so-called normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) was developed. NDVI is an arithmetic band combination of red and NIR bands in a normalised value range. \r\nThe NDVI is calculated as:\r\nNDVI=((NIR-R))/((NIR+R))\r\nThe (hypothetic) value range of the NDVI is [-1 | +1]. Under real-world conditions, the NDVI ranges from values of around -0.2 to 0.6 or 0.7. To discriminate principal land cover classes such as water, non-vegetation (soil, sealed, etc.) and vegetation the following thresholds in the continuous range are used:  \r\n\tNDVI < ~ 0: water\r\n\t~ 0 < NDVI < ~ 0.2: non-vegetation (soil, sealed surfaces, bare rock, etc.)\r\n\t~ 0.2 < NDVI: vegetation.\r\nNotably, these class limits are just a very rough approximation (indicated by the ~ sign), due to the mixed pixels effect, canopy reflectance, the abundance of water plants and suspending particles, and the illumination effect of specific atmospheric or topographic conditions. \r\nWe can use the NDVI to generally mask out vegetation from other land cover types and, more specifically, to indicate vegetation vigour and health. It is also suitable for monitoring plant phenology as the relationship between vegetative growth and the (changing) conditions of the environmental conditions. A range of variations has been suggested, enhancing one or the other mathematical or statistical behaviour of the index, or making it even more sensitive to specific plant behaviour. A well-known example is the enhanced vegetation index (EVI).",

The calculated spectral index is a ‘new’ image that highlights particular land surface features or properties e.g. vegetation, soil, water, better than the original input bands. The spectral indices vary from simple spectral ratioing of two bands to more complex combinations of multiple bands. Spectral indexes are developed based on the spectral properties of the object of interest. For example, spectral indices dedicated to the vegetation condition are developed based on the principle that the healthy vegetation reflects strongly in the near-infrared spectrum while absorbing strongly in the visible red. These properties are used to develop more complex spectral indexes for monitoring vegetation condition, phenology parameters, i.e. Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Advanced Vegetation Index (AVI). The spectral indices calculated using the short wave infrared spectral bands are more sensitive to vegetation water content and spongy mesophyll structure in the vegetation canopy thus are used to assess the vegetation decline, moisture that is particularly useful for drought monitoring (e.g. Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) or Normalized Difference Moisture Index – NDMI). The water-related spectral indices are widely applied in agricultural and ecological applications including surface water body characteristics, vegetation water stress, soil water content assessment and wetlands monitoring. The combination of near infrared and short wave infrared spectral bands is also used to detect burned area and to monitor the vegetation recovery (e.g. Normalised Burned Ratio – NBR). There are other spectral indices dedicated to snow cover and glacier monitoring, which are developed based on visual green and short wave infrared spectral bands. Snow reflects most of the radiation in the visible bands whiles absorbing in the short wave infrared.",

The resulting scalar values represent the spectral behaviour in different bands in a single value; such procedure makes particular sense, when spectral behaviour varies in those bands (like the red edge of vegetation spectra in the NIR band). \r\nThere are several reasons for applying band maths when working with multispectral imagery: (1) A single range of values rather than multiple bands is easier to comprehend and interpret; (2) Thresholds or class limits are applied more intuitively in a grey scale image; (3) Indices can be easily calculated and compared across different sensors; they are implemented as standard routines in many software environments as well as cloud processing environments (such as Google Earth Engine or the Proba-V exploitation platform)\r\nOut of the many possible, literature suggests a few arithmetic band combinations as application-specific quasi-standards. Band ratios (e.g. red band divided by NIR band) and indices (such as the normalised difference vegetation index, NDVI) belong to this group. Indices have the advantage over simple ratios in constraining the value range, e.g. [-1 | 1]. Designated to indicate specific land cover types (such as water index, snow index, soil index, etc.) such indices are widely used as a basis for operational information products. Another index is the normalised burn ratio (NBR) which relates near infrared and short-wave infrared reflectance to measure burn severity taking into consideration the increasing of SWIR reflectance in the course of a fire. \r\nPre-processing such as dark object subtraction and radiometric or even atmospheric correction is a key requirement prior to indexing. The coding in digital numbers (DN) is a function of the sensitivity and the radiometric resolution of the sensor. The actual recording depends on atmospheric conditions (additional brightness, haze, etc.). Therefore, in order to make the resulting values comparable among different types of sensors and scenes, radiometric correction is mandatory, converting DNs into radiances, i.e. true reflectance values as physical measurement units.  \r\nTwo advanced examples of band maths beyond rationing are the perpendicular vegetation index (PVI) and the tasselled cap (TC) transformation. PVI is based on the assumption that vegetation pixels are generally separable from soil pixels (at least after unmixing or for pure pixels), and thus pixel values are located in a perpendicular direction from the soil line in a NIR/red feature space. The Euclidean distance from the soil line, determined by Pythagorean triangle, yields the PVI.  Tasselled cap instead rests on the notion of a cap-like histogram shape when plotting pixels on a brightness vs. greenness plot, with the latter determined by linear combinations of VIS and NIR bands, along with empirically determined coefficients. TC 1 as a weighted sum corresponds to brightness, TC 2 to greenness, TC 3 to yellowness, sometimes referred to as wetness. A fourth TC called nonesuch likely corresponds to noise and atmospheric disturbance effects in the image.",

Conditional changes refer to the change in condition at the surface such as water stress in an agricultural field, forest degradation caused by pest. \r\nIn the past, many remote sensing studies used two images to detect different types of changes such as deforestation, land cover change or change in the health or condition of the vegetation (e.g. pest infestation). Meanwhile, satellite image time series are used to assess the change. Time series analysis allows for monitoring more subtle changes and for providing temporal patterns of change. In this way, the timing of changes and drivers of change can be easily identified. \r\nDifferent methods are being used in change detection studies. There are studies that analyze individual images available in the investigated time series to map the target class/phenomena/events at the time when images were collected and to identify the changes: e.g. mapping the mangroves extent on an year basis and measuring it to identify changes. Alternative studies search for breaks in time series for detecting changes.

Straight and sharp edge shape represent typically the anthropogenic features i.e. urban or agriculture, the natural features like rivers, wetlands are more irregular in shape. Size of objects in an image is a function of scale and it depends on the spatial resolution of the image. The assessment of the size of the target’s object in relation to other objectives as well as an absolute size of the object are the important part of the interpretation. Pattern refers to the spatial arrangement of objects, i.e. network of street and houses in an urban area, orchards with the line of trees. Texture refers to the arrangement of frequency of tonal variation in particular areas of an image. Rough texture would have very large, coarse tonal variation (e.g. forest canopy), whereas smooth texture very little tonal version (e.g. uniform, homogenous surfaces). It depends on the size, shape and pattern of objects. Shadow depends on the scale and spatial resolution of an image. Shadow is useful to measure the height of an object, to distinguish the coniferous from broadleaf trees. In the radar imagery is useful for identifying topography and landforms.  Association refers to the relationship between objects and features in proximity to the target interest.",

The importance of the image characteristics varied according to the spatial resolution of the images and the properties of the feature of interest. The interpretation can be performed on the single image or between several images acquired at different time, which result in the differentiation of the temporal changes. The principle of the image interpretation is the process of delineating (digitalizing) the outlines of the objects, features on the image. It is performed “on-screen” using a GIS software.

            "description": "A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is a digital raster (or grid) representation of elevation values of land surface shapes and features, where each grid cell takes a single elevation value with reference to a certain vertical datum. A DEM can be global, regional or local in scope, and can be used to characterize the dry land surface (topography) or submerged surfaces (bathymetry). Since a DEM cannot contain information of shapes and features under overhanging structures, it is often referred to as 2.5D instead of truly 3D. \r\nA digital elevation model is an overarching term for either a digital surface model (DSM) or digital terrain model (DTM). A DSM includes elevations of surface features such as trees, buildings, bridges and artificial objects such as poles, power lines, cars etc., and thus contains always the highest elevations of any feature for any given raster cell. A DTM does not include such features but reflects the elevation of bare land surface shapes, excluding elevated or overhanging features.\r\nDEMs can be obtained using active or passive measurements. Active measurements involve the generation of electromagnetic signals towards a surface and timing the reception of the (return) signal(s). This can be achieved through laser scanning (LiDAR) using visible or infrared light pulses for bathymetric or topographic measurements respectively, radio waves (SONAR) used in bathymetric measurements, or microwaves (synthetic aperture radar, SAR) used in topographic mapping. The most widely known active remotely sensed global DEM is derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) obtained by a SAR mounted on the space shuttle Endeavour, offering  30 m resolution with a vertical accuracy typically between 5 and 20 m, covering 80% of Earth’s surface.\r\nPassive measurements detect reflection of sun light, or energy radiated from the surfaces. Their distance to the detector can then be inferred from the measurement of angles. Historically, line scanning imagers were used, but nowadays, these are replaced by acquisitions of overlapping 2D frame images. On the images, corresponding land surface features are detected which act as tie-points. The distance between the sensor and the tie-points is calculated in a process called photogrammetry. The most widely known spaceborne passive remotely sensed global DEM is derived from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data onboard the Terra satellite. It offers similar resolution and accuracy compared to SRTM, but with 99% coverage. \r\nOnly LiDAR can generate both accurate DSMs and DTMs from the same data acquisition, by using multiple returns from a single emitted pulse. All other techniques generate DSMs, from which elevated features can be identified and filtered out in postprocessing to create DTMs, however with typically lower accuracy and more artefacts.",

A feature is an individual measurable property or characteristic of a geographic phenomenon being observed. Features in Earth observation include the individual bands of images and further properties derived from the image data. For example, the single band of a panchromatic image represents a feature that allows distinguishing between pixels of darker and lighter reflectance. Multispectral images have more bands and thereby enable the differentiation between classes by more features. This means, if two classes are different from each other in several of their properties, it becomes easier to distinguish them. The set of features used in a particular classification comprise the feature space where each feature represents one space dimension. \r\nWith an increased number of features it becomes possible to increase the number of classes that can be separated. For example land cover classifications have a large number of classes. For identifying suitable bands for optical EO satellites, the spectral signatures of all the target classes have to be analysed to identify in which bands they are separable from other classes. Classes like soil, water, and vegetation have spectral signatures that differ in particular in the blue, green, red, and infrared bands of the electromagnetic spectrum. These bands are present in virtually all multispectral sensors used for land cover classification. \r\nAs geographic phenomena differ by more than their reflectance in different bands, further properties have been used for classification. In addition to multispectral features, the classification may include image derivatives like derived spectral indices, principal components, or filtered bands (convolution layers).

Its main objectives were to overcome the rigidity of a-priori land cover classifications, which in many practical situations do not allow easy assignment into one of the pre-defined classes and are therefore not very suitable for mapping. LCCS instead opted for an approach based on two main phases. The first phase is an initial ‘Dichotomous Phase’, in which eight major land cover types are defined: (1) Cultivated and Managed Terrestrial Areas, (2) Natural and Semi-Natural Terrestrial Vegetation, (3) Cultivated Aquatic or Regularly Flooded Areas, (4) Natural and Semi-Natural Aquatic or Regularly Flooded Vegetation, (5) Artificial Surfaces and Associated Areas, (6) Bare Areas, (7) Artificial Waterbodies, Snow and Ice, and (8) Natural Waterbodies, Snow and Ice. The Dichotomous Phase is followed by a subsequent ‘Modular-Hierarchical Phase’, in which land cover classes are created by the combination of sets of pre-defined classifiers, which are different for each of the eight major land cover types. For example, common classifiers used for (semi-) natural terrestrial vegetation types are Life Form, Cover, Height, Macropattern. For aquatic or regularly flooded natural and semi-natural vegetation, water seasonality is an indispensable classifier. LCCS offers several advantages from a conceptual point of view. LCCS is a real a priori classification system in the sense that, for the classifiers considered, it covers all their possible combinations. The classification is also hierarchical and the more classifiers used, the greater the detail of the defined land cover class. The classes derived from the proposed classification system are all unique and unambiguous, due to the internal consistency and systematic description of the classes. LCCS is designed to map at a variety of scales, from small to large. From a practical viewpoint LCCS offers several advantages: (1) easy incorporation into GIS and databases, (2) allows flexible response to information available in a given area, project budget and time constraints, (3) unlinks the field data collection from the interpretation process.",

Therefore, baseline datasets are necessary that allow assessing changes of land cover and land use where the class definitions remain consistent over time. Accordingly, classification schemes have been established that adhere to taxonomically correct definitions of classes of information organized according to logical criteria. If hard classification is to be performed (i.e. without fuzzy class boundaries), the classes in the classification system should normally be mutually exclusive, exhaustive, and hierarchical. Mutual exclusive classes have no taxonomic overlap and assign a land cover patch to a single class. An exhaustive classification scheme is able to cover the area of interest comprehensively and leaves no land cover patch unassigned. A hierarchical system allows combining sub-classes into higher-level categories.\r\nFrom a remote sensing classification perspective, it becomes clear that a classification scheme consists of information classes defined by human beings. Conversely, spectral classes are those inherent to EO data. An analyst must identify spectral classes and label them as information classes that satisfy bureaucratic (or scientific requirements). Additionally, the advantage of using established classification schemes is that their use in scientific studies and applications produces results that are comparable to other studies and suitable for sharing of data.\r\nEstablished classification schemes include: CORINE land cover (CLC), Land cover classification system (LCCS), American Planning Association land-based classification standard, United States Geological Survey land-use/land-cover classification system for remote sensor data, U.S. Department of the Interior Fish & Wildlife Service classification of wetland and deep water habitats of the United States, U.S. National Vegetation Classification system (NVCS), International Geosphere-Biosphere Program IGBP Land cover classification system.",

SVM algorithm was originally designed for binary classification. The SVM is based on the main hypothesis that the training set is linearly separable. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one or another of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that can assign each new occurrence into one of these two categories, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier. The SVM model is a representation of the examples as points in space, mapped so that the algorithm can find the optimal line (hyperplane) which separates with minimum error the training set, and maximizes the distance, named the “gap”, between the objects of both classes and the hyperplane. Thus, instead of using the whole available training set to describe classes, SVM uses only those training samples that describe class boundaries (support vectors), thought it can be more efficient than other algorithm because it uses a subset of training points. New occurs are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on the side of the gap on which they fall. In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can also efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces. Unfortunately, because of the technique used for separating classes SVM is less effective on noisier datasets with overlapping classes. When data are unlabelled, supervised learning is not possible, and an unsupervised learning approach is required. SVM is used for text classification tasks such as category assignment, spam detection and sentimental analysis. It is also commonly used for image recognition, performing particularly well in aspect-based recognition and colour-based recognition.

In complement to the resulting sematic labelling products, a secondary outcome are instructions or rulesets with the used parameters that constitute the documentation of the classification process.\r\nThe input imagery consists of one or more images (optical and/or SAR data) of a specific geographic area, collected in multiple bands of the electromagnetic spectrum (that may have already undergone certain pre-processing steps; determined by the purpose).

What sounds rather straight forward, is in fact a great computational challenge, some even call it an ill-posed problem, because there is a high degree of ambiguity in this process. \r\nThe two attributes in the general definition provided above, i.e. neighbouring and similar, evoke the principles of regionalisation as a fundamental concept in geography. Regionalisation is the bottom-up approach to congregate adjacent elements with the aim to form a larger unit. (Conversely, this could be understood in a top-down manner when subdividing a larger whole into smaller homogeneous units). This follows the general notion of hierarchical organisation according to general systems theory (GST). The organisation of a state in smaller administrative units is a good example for a hierarchical structure, the composition of the human body by organs, cells, etc. another. In image analysis such regions are commonly referred to image regions, originating from the concept of “photomorphic regions”, literally meaning regions formed on images – originally by human interpreter through manual delineation. Today, advanced pixel grouping algorithms aim to delineate homogenous regions in an image automatically. As those regions usually are assumed to match with real-world objects, it is often stated in literature that image segmentation generates image objects. Deriving some general heuristics on their properties (colour, size, shape, orientation, etc.) we can label these objects according to a given semantic scheme. The procedure of object delineation and classification using object features and relations is a fundamental principle in object-based image analysis (OBIA). \r\nDue to the effect of spatial autocorrelation (the tendency of neighbouring pixels to be similar irrespective of scale or geographical location), pixel grouping is ambiguous and by no means trivial, but not arbitrary either. Intuitively, image regions are those quasi-homogeneous areas that we perceive as landscape units on a specific scene (a lake, a forest patch, a single tree, a building, a residential area). According to hierarchy theory, we can assume that we find multiple scales within a single image even, according to the level of detail we are interested in. Whether or not a specific grouping of pixels is considered valid, e.g. because it corresponds to a real-world object, can hardly be answered unanimously, but rather needs to be judged by experts in the respective application domain. That is why often in literature we find the term ‘meaningful objects’. \r\nImage segmentation is as a sub-field of computer vision and aims to apply computer algorithms to generate image regions (a.k.a. tokens) within digital image analysis. There are several strategies for performing image segmentation, all resting on the following general principles: (1) regions do not overlap; (2) regions are (relatively) homogenous; regions are (relatively) different to neighbouring regions; regions are fairly equally sized (belong to one scale domain) but can be built in several hierarchical scales. General strategies include (1) edge-based segmentation and (2) region-based segmentation, and multi-scale segmentation as a specific case. \r\nAlso referred to spatial classification emphasizing the constraint of spatial contingency, image segmentation aggregates neighbouring pixels, but – as compared to statistical clustering techniques – does not provide a unique set of classes (either semantic or statistic) in the feature space. \r\nRecently the term semantic segmentation has emerged in the machine-learning community, which is in fact a combination of segmentation and categorisation (labelling) via deep learning methods (e.g. convolutional neural networks).",

The radiative transfer theory provides the most logical linkage between observations and physical processes that generate signals in optical remote sensing. Radiative transfer modelling is therefore an integral part of  remote sensing, since it provides the most efficient tool for accurate retrievals of Earth properties from satellite data. Radiative transfer models  are used in a number of different applications such as sensor radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction and the modelling radiation processes in vegetation canopies. \r\nVegetation radiative transfer models (RTMs) study the relationship between leaf and canopy biophysical variables and reflectance, absorbance and scattering mechanisms. The infinite variability of vegetation structure complicates the modeling of RT in vegetation canopies. Numerous models of RT in vegetation canopies were developed in the second half of the last century. Models differ by the details accounted for and by the simplifications introduced in the description of canopy structure and photon–vegetation interactions. Gradual improvement in RTMs accuracy, yet in complexity too, have diversified RTMs from simple turbid medium RTMs towards advanced Monte Carlo RTMs that allow for explicit 3D representations of complex canopy architectures. This evolution has resulted in an increase in the computational requirements to run the model, which bears implications towards practical applications. When choosing an RTM, a trade-off between invertibility and realism has to be made: simpler models are easier to invert but less realistic, while advanced models more realistic but require a large amount of variables to be configured. The two most widely used models are the leaf model PROSPECT and Scattering by Arbitrary Inclined Leaves (SAIL) canopy model. \r\nAtmosphere RTMs study the interaction of radiation with the atmosphere. The remotely-sensed signals at satellite or airborne platforms are combinations of surface and atmospheric contributions, with relative amounts varying across the two wavelength regions, depending on the condition of the atmosphere.  The order of magnitude of atmosphere signals can be equal or larger than that of land or ocean surface signals that arise at the top of the atmosphere (TOA). In order to derive accurate sensor calibration and atmospheric correction, the contribution of the atmospheric constituents to the total retrieved signal must be understood and modelled. Atmospheric radiative transfer models simulate the radiative transfer interactions of light scattering,  absorption and emission through the atmosphere. Some widely used atmospheric RTMs are 6SV, libRadtran, MODTRAN, and ATCOR.\r\nAdvances in radiative transfer modeling enhance our ability to detect and monitor changes in our planet through new methodologies and technical approaches to analyze and interpret measurements from air- and space-borne sensors.",

Thereby image understanding is the process of scene reconstruction, the description and mental representation of the content of imaged, and potentially complex, realities. \r\nImage understanding thereby goes beyond single feature extraction. Instead, it aims at  a complete description of the image content, i.e. the reconstruction of a real-world scene. In the early days of digital image processing, image understanding was mainly confined to identifying and labelling image primitives. Today, advanced mapping keys and hierarchical classification schemes to analyse EO data, include composite and complex target classes. Thereby ‘full’ scene description means reaching from signal processing to a symbolic representation of the scene content. This entails the relationships of real‐world objects in different scales and spatio-temporal aspects.\r\nDescribing a scene, visually or computer-aided or mixed, depends on a conceptual framework comprising (a) the underlying research question within (b) a specific field of application and (c) pre‐existing knowledge and experience of the operator. Obtaining insights from imagery requires general knowledge about the expected scene content and domain expertise. The field of image understanding is interlinked with image (pre-)processing, computer vision, and artificial intelligence (AI). Image processing conditions the data material and enhances the interpretation source. Computer vision including pattern recognition providing knowledge representation, expert systems. AI is mainly concerned with automation processes, be it via  knowledge transfer to an automated system or machine / deep learning.\r\nIn analogy to the human mind, image understanding is the computational process of extracting information from images, i.e. locating, characterizing, and recognizing objects and other features in the depicted scene. However, image understanding is not a linear, but rather a cyclic process and takes place during the pre-processing and data assimilation steps. For example, cloud masks on EO images is an early product of image understanding, prior to many pre-processing tasks.\r\nIn a typical GEOBIA workflow, the process of image understanding can be illustrated by the following steps: Starting from the subset of a real‐world scene captured on an image first step may entail scaled representations by grouping neighbouring pixels on several hierarchical sales. The multi‐scale segmentation provides a set of nested objects with geospatial and spectral properties to be used in the classification process. \r\nWith object hypotheses in mind the object relation modelling can be realized by encoding expert knowledge into a rule system. This setp aims at categorizing the image objects by their spectral and spatial properties and their mutual relationships. Hereby, an object‐centred view is accomplished. This representation of the image content should meet the conceptual reality of the interpreter or user. Knowledge is stepwise adapted and improved through progressive interpretation and modelling.

            "description": "A growing set of EO services and applications produce EO products that describe various aspects of the land, ocean and atmosphere. These products include for example image products at different processing levels, geometric measurements like in digital elevation models, semantic labelling products like land cover classifications, and EO-derived attribute products concerning air quality or other geophysical and biophysical parameters. Same as any geospatial data, EO products are not free of error and require accompanying documentation of their product quality. One term for describing different quality dimensions of an EO product is accuracy.\r\nAccuracy is a measure to estimate the uncertainty that originates from errors. An error is the deviation of a map value from a true value. The concept of error assumes well-defined phenomena where deviation results from imperfection of measurement equipment, environment effects, or imperfections of the observer. They cause gross errors and blunders, systematic errors, and random errors, for which different approaches are necessary to minimize error. Ideally, only random error remains that is probabilistic in nature and can be assessed with statistical approaches. For poorly defined phenomena, the concept of vagueness applies. For example in the case of thematic maps using fuzzy sets, the accuracy assessment requires a fuzzy approach as well. \r\nJudging error requires reference data with higher accuracy (by an order of magnitude) to which the map value can be compared. EO product quality dimensions about accuracy include thematic accuracy, spatial accuracy (both horizontal and vertical), radiometric accuracy, and accuracy of biophysical/geophysical parameter measurements. Respective equipment and approaches for reference data collection includes ground verification for thematic maps, GNSS positioning devices, field spectrometers, air quality sensors and in-situ biomass estimation. Ideally, reference data is collected in the field. In case of inaccessible areas of interest and/or if the service requirements allow it, approaches may rely on proxy reference data.\r\nThe design of the accuracy assessment procedure should be done with the EO product design to match the requirements of the EO service. For example, a thematic accuracy assessment consists of the main three components of response design, analysis, and sampling design. The response design ensures that reference data and map data are comparable at a location and specifies under which cases they agree or disagree. The analysis, usually performed with an error matrix, specifies which quality indicators will be calculated to quantify accuracy. The sampling design specifies the subset of locations at which the response design will be applied. Depending on the classification process and application case, different sampling strategies can be suitable (e.g. clustered sampling, stratified random sampling). \r\nFor other accuracy dimensions, respective accuracy assessment procedures exist, e.g. root mean squared error (RSME) for the positional accuracy assessment.\r\nAfter an accuracy assessment has been performed and the uncertainty in the EO product is understood, the challenge is to clarify how the uncertainty affects subsequent spatial analyses with the EO product. Different strategies exist that ignore error completely or that account for error by modelling uncertainty in the analysis outcomes. If uncertainty is judged low enough (or more hazardous, if users are unaware of the limited accuracy), subsequent analyses accept the EO product as true and ignore the accuracy value. If uncertainty is incorporated in subsequent analysis through uncertainty modelling, the results describe the bandwidth of outcomes, potentially supported with appropriate visualisations of uncertainty. The uncertainty modelling approach may greatly enhance the usability of the EO product, because it informs better how the error impacts the EO information and how much confidence a user should have in it.\r\nWith a new generation of EO products on the horizon and a largely increased user community, a large number of new applications is to be expected. They may also identify innovative accuracy assessment approaches. For example, the availability of EO archives with long time series of EO data led to response design protocols tailored to collect time series of reference data. The use of volunteered geographic information (VGI) as reference data has great potential, if approaches are implemented that ensure its reliability. Methods for object-based accuracy assessment are continued to be developed. Further, the increasing number of EO parameter products based on continuous variables creates the need to describe their accuracy. Finally, the focus on validation of EO products during EO service development and operation will make feedback from users available to service providers, ultimately leading to more meaningful EO products with more meaningful accuracy metrics and other quality indicators.",

Next to that, from an optical remote sensing point of view, clouds can be roughly classified in: opaque/dense clouds, mainly composed of droplets that are highly reflective in the VIS region and generally located at low-medium altitudes and cirrus, consisting of a large number of thin non-spherical ice crystals that are normally translucent in the VIS region, relatively highly reflective in the SWIR spectrum, and located at high altitude.\r\n\r\nThe goal of cloud cover percentage is to provide a quality measure of usable information in a surface reflectance image. Earth observation product catalogs support it as a query parameter, to enable searching for products with a cloud cover percentage below a given threshold.\r\nThis simplifies for instance use cases that require only fully clear products (0% cloud cover), and may save download and processing resources by only handling images that have some valid pixels. For instance, by only using products with a cloud cover percentage smaller than 99.95%. The measure also gives an estimate of the number of valid observations in a given geographical area, allowing a quick assessment of whether minimal data requirements for a specific use case are met.\r\n\r\nThe measure is a percentage of actual observations in an image, so pixels where no data was recorded are not included. For derived products, cloud cover pixels are often also flagged separately from pixels where no data was recorded, but this may depend on the data provider. The definition specifically also includes cloud shadow pixels.\r\nReliable cloud cover percentages depend on good cloud and cloud shadow detection methods. Especially handling of translucent cirrus clouds is an open issue: a product that has a 100% cloud cover percentage due to cirrus clouds might still be usable for some cases, while for other cases they also render the product useless. \r\n\r\nThe used cloud detection algorithm will also affect the cloud cover percentage. A more strict algorithm will yield higher percentages compared to an algorithm that under detects clouds.\r\nDue to these limitations, cloud cover percentages in product metadata have a fairly high error margin.

A geographic phenomenon can be named or described, georeferenced and provided with a time interval at which it exists. The geographic phenomenon of interest is the one of which a user needs information to help him make a decision. Therefore, the geographic phenomenon needs to be resolved with a low enough uncertainty and a high enough quality that allows the user to make a decision with confidence. \r\nFor example, let’s consider a helicopter pilot that wants to know whether a specific site is suitable for an emergency landing. The decision to perform an emergency landing may be supported with an EO-derived digital map of emergency landing sites that are flat enough (as well as large enough for the pilot’s helicopter and free of any obstacles on the surface and in the approach area). If we only focus on the flatness of the terrain, we need a digital elevation model (DEM) of high enough spatial resolution and accuracy in the Z dimension to calculate slope within acceptable levels of uncertainty. The pilot probably can tell us what degrees of slope are okay for his helicopter and tell us sites (e.g. football fields) where such a landing would succeed. However, this is only the input to an analysis of different DEMs to identify the minimum spatial resolution and accuracy in the Z dimension to model slope products and associated uncertainty to derive an emergency landing site product that fulfils the requirements. Thereby the capability of different DEMs to resolve emergency landing sites can be analysed.\r\nSpatial resolution is a measure of the smallest angular or linear separation between two objects that can be resolved by the remote sensing system. A useful heuristic rule of thumb is that in order to detect a feature, the nominal spatial resolution of the sensor should be less than one-half the size of the feature measured in its smallest dimension.\r\nOther types of resolution of an EO dataset are available that determine for various geographic phenomena under investigation whether it is possible to resolve them in the data. These are radiometric resolution, spectral resolution and temporal resolution. Radiometric resolution is defined as the sensitivity of a remote sensing detector to differences in signal strength as it records the radiant flux reflected, emitted, or back-scattered from the terrain. Spectral resolution is the number and dimension (size) of specific wavelength intervals (referred to as bands or channels) in the electromagnetic spectrum to which a remote sensing instrument is sensitive. The temporal resolution of a remote sensing system generally refers to how often the sensor records imagery of a particular area. For time-series analysis, the temporal resolution determines the time granularity for resolving processes that underlie the change that is observable between subsequent images.",

Remote sensing data acquisition phase involves the following quality aspects: resolution, accessibility, spatial accuracy, temporal validity, accuracy and precision of the sensor calibration. Resolution is a multi-dimensional concept that includes the following dimensions: spatial resolution, temporal resolution, radiometric resolution, spectral resolution and temporal resolution. Temporal validity refers to the quality of an remote sensing data product in time, whereas spatial accuracy refers to the accuracy of the position of features relative the Earth.  \r\nData storage includes the accessibility and completeness data quality dimensions.  Accessibility includes both temporal and data accessibility. Temporal accessibility refers to the time delay between data acquisition and data delivery, whereas data accessibility refers to the availability of remote sensing data. Data completeness encompasses temporal completeness, i.e. completeness of a time series represented a phenomenon, thematic completeness, and spatial completeness which refers to the area coverage. Data preprocessing, processing and analysis phase includes consistency, completeness, temporal validity, resolution, radiometric and geometric accuracy, thematic and semantic accuracy. Thematic and sematic accuracy refers to the correctness of the remote sensing data product.

Metadata can be stored in a catalog compliant to one of the available data cataloging standards such as the  SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) compliant catalog; (2) Accessible: all data have to be openly accessible and shared using interoperable formats that allow users to find, access and reuse them; (3) Interoperable: different standards, e.g. STAC specification, have to be used to document remote sensing data; (4) Reusable: metadata have to be comprehensive enough to allow users not only to assess the fitness for purpose (e.g. lineage) but also to provide them information about how to access the generated data.",

They support a user in decision-making and thereby benefit the user’s purpose. The information value chain is a tool for evaluating business management and profitability. It enables explaining the ultimate “value” of a product and the components along the value chain and consequently allows businesses to optimize their processes. \r\nThe value of EO data can be assessed by analysing the contribution of the data to a specific EO information product and its effective use in decision-making. The (share of) benefit attributable to the use of the given EO data is derived from the comparison of a decision taken using the EO product to a counterfactual situation where other types of information are used instead. Often, this compares the situation before a new  EO service was available to the situation afterwards. An ex-post analysis may reveal improved performances, e.g. gains in output, or productivity and/or reduced costs as compared to those occurring in absence of EO-derived information. This benefit resides with the user of the EO product and may be traced to societal and environmental benefits through impact chains.\r\nThe process of EO information production and distribution is integrated in the value chain and can be defined as the image processing chain. It comprises the value-adding activities of the organization(s) that lead up to the availability of an EO product for decision making. The nature and flow of these activities and the collaboration between organizations and among participants within organizations can be modelled with business process model and notation (BPMN). BPMN is a flowchart diagram that uses swimlanes representing different participants. Processes are assigned to participants and are connected with arrows into flow sequences. Further elements complete the choice of symbols for modelling a consistent flow, including a start event, end events, and branching options. They allow organizing the flow in parallel or iterative processes. Higher-level processes can be (de-)composed with sub-processes. Additionally, it is possible to use pools and message flows for explicitly modelling collaboration between participants (from different organizations).\r\nIn the image processing (value) chain, the sequence of processing steps begins with the acquisition of EO data, followed by steps of pre-processing and information extraction (or whatever steps are necessary) and ends with an EO information product being available to a user that uses it to make his decision. The collaborating stakeholders along the chain include EO satellite operators, EO data providers, EO information providers, and the users at the end of the value chain. The stakeholders along the processing chain each perform a dedicated subsequence of processing steps. Thereby, the stakeholders contribute their share of value to the data they deliver to the next stakeholder in the chain, ultimately arriving a the EO information product for the user. The EO data products that they hand on along the chain are often described with processing levels that provide different states of processing of EO data. They start with raw instrument data (level 0 and 1) that are followed by data converted into geophysical quantities that are geo-referenced and calibrated (level 2). Further levels are quality controlled data that has been mapped on a uniform space-time grid (level 3) and data combined with models or other instrument data (level 4). In addition, EO data providers use the term analysis ready data (ARD) that have been processed to allow direct data analysis, i.e. user processing effort is reduced to a minimum. Further, the standard EO products contain a categorizing element that is related to the image processing value chain. This categorizing element organizes the EO products along the sequences of processing, descriptive analytics, predictive analytics, prescriptive analytics, aggregation, visualization, and distribution. Thereby, the products ultimately contribute to the actionable EO information product for the use in decision-making.",

The knowledge area includes also several inter-organizational and institutional aspects of GIS&T. Particular attention is paid to the concept of geospatial data sharing, which is about the creation of `spatial data` connections and relationships between different organizations in the GIS&T domain. Spatial data infrastructures are developed to promote, facilitate and coordinate the sharing of spatial data among data providers and data users, and consists of several technological and non-technological components.

One fundamental argument for sharing thus derives from scale economies in production.

Sharing allows data to be used repeatedly for many purposes, thus increasing their value without increasing their cost. Sharing data also leads to improved data quality.

Data, metadata, access networks, standards, coordination, policies, funding, people and institutional frameworks are often considered among the key components of an SDI. \r\n\r\nSpatial data infrastructures often are defined and described as a complex and dynamic phenomenon. Among the main reasons for the complex character of these infrastructures are the many components a spatial data infrastructure consists of, the diversity of involved stakeholders, and the many different objectives and ambitions of these stakeholders. Technological advancements, such as the emergence of web 2.0 technologies, and societal changes, such as the increasing use of geographic information in everyday life, are often mentioned as important drivers behind the dynamic character of spatial data infrastructures. \r\n\r\nA key characteristic of spatial data infrastructures is the involvement of a large and diverse group of actors. Governments are often considered as the central actors in the development and implementation of spatial data infrastructure, since they are the major producers and users of geographic information. Governments at different administrative levels and in different thematic domains are involved in the creation, management, use and sharing of geographic data.

The SDI coordination structure should ensure that all stakeholders are involved in the development and implementation of the SDI, through the participation in one or more coordination bodies.

An SDI funding model provides the answer to the central question of where and how to seek funding for implementing and maintaining an SDI. Within an SDI often different funding models will be combined, as the selection of the most appropriate funding model will be linked to different activities and the associated costs. Costs of an SDI include both set-up costs (one off costs) and maintenance costs (yearly), of which certain costs need to be made for each data sets or each data provider and other costs for the infrastructure in general. The most commonly used SDI funding models are centralized government funding, decentralized government funding (e.g. for each data provider), partnership funding, funding through revenues, and government funding based on donor agencies or on European projects.\r\n\r\nThe shift towards open data and the adoption of open data policies had an important impact on the funding model of many SDIs, as governments and organizations no longer could rely on revenues from selling their data and had to look for other funding models. As a result, new pricing strategies are employed, such as the provision of fee-based supplementary services, such as advice or tailor-made products based on open data. Also freemium/premium models, in which a basic version of the dataset is offered as open data (freemium) but the full dataset is available for a fee (premium), were considered as an alternative approach. In many cases, the loss of revenues was compensated by other funding models, such as increased government funding.",

Assessment and evaluations of SDIs are a useful tool for those organizations and people directly involved in these initiatives, but also for researchers, citizens, journalists and other stakeholders. Decision makers and practitioners can use assessments to monitor the progress against the objectives of their SDI initiatives and to identify areas where improvement can be achieved. Assessment also allows to compare and benchmark the performance of different organizations or countries, and to learn from best practices. Finally, assessment also is relevant for accountability, since it enables governments and agencies to be held accountable for their decisions, activities and the resources they have invested. Assessment of SDIs, which deals with the collection and supply of information on the performance of SDI initiatives, should be seen as the first step in a logical consequence of collecting data, integrating this data in policy and management cycles and actually using the information. \r\n\r\nIn the past twenty years, many different SDI assessment frameworks have been developed by researchers and practitioners around the world. Examples of such frameworks are the INSPIRE State of Play Study, the Clearinghouse Suitability Index, the Organisational Maturity Matrix, the SDI Readiness Index, and the INSPIRE Monitoring and Reporting approach. Each of these frameworks focus on particular aspects and components of SDIs. In line with the categorization of open data assessment, also SDI assessments can be divided into three main categories: (1) readiness assessments, (2) implementation or data assessments, and (3) impact assessments. Readiness assessments analyse whether conditions are appropriate, and whether necessary components are in place for developing an SDI. Implementation or Data assessments evaluate whether geospatial data are available and accessible.

It is possible to invert the Planck Function to obtain from the emitted radiance at a prefixed wavelength the temperature T=f(B, λ) of the emitting Black Body.

Since each element has a characteristic spectrum of absorbed/emitted wavelengths (spectral signature), atomic spectroscopy allows the determination of elemental compositions even of remote objects (e.g. stars, galaxies, etc.).\r\nStarting from the simple Bohr’s model it is possible to predict quite exactly the frequencies of e.m. radiation selectively absorbed/emitted by all atoms. Depending on the atomic number Z, characteristic frequencies f are absorbed or emitted by atoms corresponding to the electronic transitions from different energetic (quantized) states following the Bohr’s condition: fab=(Eb- Ea)/h,  being Ei=-cost∙Z2/(ni)2 the electron energy corresponding to the state/level i (principal quantic number ni). By this way each atomic species has a characteristic spectrum of absorbed/emitted frequencies (atomic spectral signature) so that  atomic spectroscopy allows the determination of elemental compositions even of remote objects. By this way the existence of Helium was discovered in the 1968 by Jansen and Lockyer in the Sun photosphere well before its discover on the Earth, and the knowledge of the chemical composition of stars and galaxies was possible well before the end of XIX century. Atomic spectroscopy provides a simple and powerful introduction (through the explanation of the more complex interactions of e.m. radiation with molecules and solid matter) to the fundamental concepts of spectral signature (which is at the base of most of the applications of aerial remote sensing of the Earth’s surface) and atmospheric windows (important for the design of optical sensors devoted to remotely sense Earth’s surface) being moreover propaedeutic to the understanding of methods for the atmospheric vertical sounding based on the concepts spectral lines broadening and related weighting functions.",

Considering the phase difference between two rays scattered from separate points of the surface, this depends on the roughness height, the incident angle and, inversely, on the radiation wavelength (λ). The Rayleight criterion states that a surface can be considered as smooth if the phase difference is less than π/2 radians.\r\nAs a consequence, in the case of normal incidence, irregularities must be less than λ/8 in height to have an effectively smooth surface. In particular: i) at optical wavelengths (e.g. 0.5 micrometers), roughness height must be less than about 60 nm to have a specular reflection from a surface. Only certain man-made surfaces (e.g. sheets of glass or metal) may meet such a condition; ii) at VHF radio wavelengths (e.g. 3 m), roughness height need only to be less than about 40 cm. Unlike the previous case, a number of natural surfaces may meet this condition.\r\nIt is worth noting that large values of the incident angle may satisfy the criterion more easily as compared with the normal incidence.

By definition the spectral emissivity of a blackbody is equal to one (the maximum) at whatever wavelength and temperature. A blackbody radiates a continuous spectrum. Real materials do not behave like a blackbody. Natural matter could radiates more in selected spectral region (like in the case of atomic or molecular gases) more frequently with a continuous spectrum (like in the case of solids) always with spectral emissivity minor or equal to 1. \r\nAnother important concept is the one related to the graybody. For gray bodies, the spectral emissivity value is constant for each wavelength value, as for black bodies, but is always less than 1. Therefore, for any given wavelength the emitted energy of a graybody is a fraction of that of a blackbody. This behavior could be quite important even for limited spectral ranges. For instance the spectral emissivity of  the sea in the TIR (Thermal InfraRed) spectral range 8-14 microns (TIR atmospheric window) can be assumed constant (about 0,98) with significant simplifications in the determination of SST (Sea Surface Temperature) from satellite sensors operating in that spectral region.  \r\nAs said above, the emissivity of the most of the bodies present in nature varies depending on the wavelength.

            "description": "The determination of spectral signatures for scenes with a high degree of spatial complexity is considered as one of the most persistent problems in atmospheric radiation, especially at the surface, where satellite observations can only be used indirectly to infer energy budget terms. In the shortwave (solar) spectral range, it is especially challenging to derive consistent albedo, absorption, and transmittance from spaceborne, aircraft, and ground-based observations for inhomogeneous cloud conditions and is closely related to the long-debated discrepancy between observed and modeled cloud absorption.\r\nThe cloud spatial structure is revealed as a spectral signature in shortwave irradiance through the physical mechanism of molecular scattering. However, the study of specific mechanisms is rather complex since the satellite instruments cannot completely describe the spatial distribution of cloud and the variability of scattering and absorption properties.  For this reason, several studies deal with the problem described above, as a challenge for estimating spectrally the cloud optical properties (such as the albedo and transmittance) as well as scattering and absorption processes taking place in the cloud system with adequate resolution. Hence, the above mechanisms can be described using three dimensional (3-D) radiative transfer models. Those models receive auxiliary information from cloud imagery and radar observations. The molecular scattering (Rayleigh) was the only one directly dependent on the wavelength of the vertical radiative flux. Moreover, it was considered as a spectral perturbation of backtracked horizontal exchange of solar radiation due to the inhomogeneous distribution of cloud. The horizontal photon transport is highly correlated to its spectral dependence.\r\nConcerning the presence of cirrus or ice clouds, the effect of their phase function and the vertical distribution were evaluated on the scattering of far infrared radiation. Thus, the accurate reconstruction of the phase function of cirrus clouds potentially indicates the need for application of a radiative transfer model. This specific module necessarily includes scattering parameters, while the accuracy of its calculations needs to be verified against real measurements. \r\nFor several applications the preliminary detection of those portions of the scene affected by the presence of clouds (cloud detection) is mandatory. For studying properties of Earth's surface targets affected by the presence of clouds are flagged just to exclude them by further analyses. In some case clouds themselves are the object of interest. In both cases the identification of clouds (and their classification) is mostly done by using (combination of) specific spectral signatures. Generally speaking  clouds are highly reflecting VIS/NIR radiation showing (due to their heigth) brigthness temperatures (in the TIR region) lower than underlying surfaces. Thin or semi-transparent clouds are still detectable for their higher reflectance over the sea which represents a quite dark bacground in the VIS/NIR/SWIR region. Over land (much more reflecting) such a test is not more efficient and more sophisticated tests (e.g. Brigthness Temperature Difference in the split window bands around 11 and 12 microns) are required.  In presence of very cold, high reflective backgrounds (e.g. snow, glaciers, etc.) both tests on the VIS reflectance and on TIR brigthness temperature could fail. More specific tests exploiting the reflectance drop of snow in the SWIR (where clouds are still saving their higher reflectance) helps to discriminate the presence of clouds from clear sky conditions even over a snow background.  In the microwaves clouds are quite transparent except when coupled with coarse particles related to rain, snow, hailstones (precipitating clouds). In that case Mie scattering dominates strongly reducing the amount of radiance collected at the sensor (lower brigthness temperature in the microwave spectral range).",

Under the linear mixing model (LMM), each observed spectrum in each pixel of a given image is assumed to result from the linear combination of the N endmember spectra present in the pixel. The reflectance spectrum of each endmember is weighted by the fractional area coverage of it in the pixel. \r\nHowever, if the components of interest in a pixel are in an intimate association, like sand grains of different composition in a beach deposit, light typically interacts with more than one component as it is multiply scattered, and the mixing between these different components are nonlinear. Such nonlinear effects have been recognized in spectra of: particulate mineral mixtures, aerosols and atmospheric particles, vegetation and canopy. In this case a non-linear mixing model (NLMM) should be applied. To summarize: Linear mixture model assumes that endmember substances are sitting side-by-side within the pixel; Nonlinear mixture model assumes that endmember components are randomly distributed throughout the pixel, causing multiple scattering effects. \r\nIn the linear mixing case, the basic premise of mixture modelling is that within a given scene, the surface is dominated by a small number of distinct materials that have relatively constant spectral properties. These distinct substances (e.g., water, grass, mineral types), characterized by a well-defined spectral signature are called endmembers, and the fractions in which they appear in a mixed pixel are called fractional abundances. Then, finding the endmembers that can be used to ‘unmix’ other mixed pixels becomes a crucial issue. \r\nIdentify fractional abundances of distinct substances from the spectral signal of a mixed pixel is one of the application in which hyperspectral images can provide an valuable support.",

The passive systems can be further subdivided into those that detect radiation emitted by the Sun (this radiation consists mostly of ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared radiation), and those that detect the thermal radiation that is emitted by all objects that are not at absolute zero (i.e. all objects). For objects at typical terrestrial temperatures, this thermal emission occurs mostly in the infrared part of the spectrum, at wavelengths of the order of 10 μm (the so called thermal infrared region), although measurable quantities of radiation also occur at longer wavelengths, as far as the microwave part of the spectrum. Active systems can, in principle, use any type of electromagnetic radiation, resulting able to obtain measurements anytime, regardless of the time of day or season. In practice, however, they are restricted by the transparency of the Earth’s atmosphere at the specific spectral range considered. In any case they can be used for examining wavelengths that are not sufficiently provided by the sun, such as microwaves, or to better control the way a target is illuminated. Active sensors may be classified according to the use that is made of the returned signal. Two main methods have been identified to this aim so far: the Ranging technique mostly concerns with the time delay between transmission and reception of the signal, while the Scattering one is mostly focused on the strength of the received signal.",

It penetrates underwater and interacts with dissolved and particulate water constituents, the optically active constituents (OACs). They absorb and scatter the light, giving water its characteristic colour and affect the light availability underwater. The three main OACs are phytoplankton, coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and suspended particulate matter (SPM) and vary in time and space. Absorption and scattering represent the inherent optical properties (IOPs) of water and depend solely on the OACs present in the water. In addition, water bodies have apparent optical properties (AOPs) that depend both on OACs and the incident light field.\r\nThe chlorophyll in the phytoplankton absorbs blue and red wavelengths and reflects green. Therefore, the oceans appear blue-green depending on the concentration of phytoplankton. CDOM is primarily tannin-stained water released from decaying detritus. High CDOM concentrations appear yellow-green to brown. CDOM absorbs ultraviolet (UV) light in the surface waters which is harmful for phytoplankton but competes with phytoplankton for light. Inorganic suspended matter (ISM) is the suspended sediment in the water. It is a component of SPM and strongly scatters longer (red) wavelengths. High ISM concentrations give water a reddish-brown colour. Pure water, however, absorbs longer wavelength red light. As natural waters vary in their composition, oceanographers introduced ocean classification schemes based on the optical properties of water. The main differentiation is between Case 1 open ocean waters and Case 2 coastal waters. In open ocean waters, the optical properties are dominated by phytoplankton and covarying material. In coastal waters, optical properties are dominated by suspended sediments and CDOM that vary independently of phytoplankton.",

As a result, the intensity of radiation would change temporally, spatially, and directionally. The study of the propagating way of radiation in matter is the radiative transfer. In more detail, the radiation traversing a medium may be attenuated due to the density, mass scattering and absorption of material. In contrast, the radiation’s intensity can be strengthened by emissions from the material plus multiple scattering from all directions. All the above interactions are described mathematically by the general radiative transfer equation.\r\nThere are different forms of RTEs that are suitable for different applications, including the RTE under different coordinate systems, the transformed RTE having good numerical properties, the RTE for refractive media, etc..

Also, this model version retrieves the optical parameters of clouds related to scattering and emissivity. The LBLRTM is widely used in radiation and climate applications. It is capable to calculate the absorption degrees of various atmospheric constituents which are utilized afterward from climate and weather prediction models for estimating the broadband solar irradiance and the heating rates.

The lowest part of the troposphere is known as the boundary layer (0-3km), where all the surface-atmosphere interactions and exchanges take place. The troposphere concentrates the water vapor and 90% of atmospheric mass, while the chemical composition of all atmospheric layers consists of nitrogen, oxygen, argon and trace gases. The main parameters that characterize the atmosphere structure are pressure, density, and temperature. All the aforementioned parameters are related to the atmospheric composition and vary with altitude, latitude, longitude and season. Additionally, the stratosphere, which is the layer above the troposphere, contains almost all of the ozone abundance (~90%) of the atmosphere in a region named as ozone layer and traced between 15 and 35km. The interaction of the incoming solar radiation with ozone in this layer causes the reduction of the incoming harmful UV radiation provoking the temperature increase in the stratospheric layer. The 99.9% of total atmospheric mass is concentrated in lower atmosphere (<50km) with Nitrogen (N2, 78.08%), Oxygen (O2, 20.95%) and argon (Ar, 0.93%) being the major constituents of the atmosphere.

In particular, the variability of the H2O concentration shows a bimodal distribution: it’s very small in the equatorial region and poleward, relatively small in stratosphere and shows a maximum in the subtropics of both hemispheres. The concentration of H2O in the lower stratosphere is controlled by the temperature of the tropical tropopause, and by the formation and dissipation of cirrus. The water vapor can condense into water droplets when it has a particle to condense upon.  The atmosphere continuously contains aerosol particles ranging in size from ∼10−3 to ∼20 μm. These aerosols are known to be produced by natural processes (volcanic dust, smoke from forest fires, particles from sea spray, windblown dust, and small particles produced by the chemical reactions of natural gases) as well as by human activity (particles directly emitted during combustion processes and particles formed from gases emitted during combustion). Some aerosols are effective condensation and ice nuclei upon which cloud particles may form. For the hygroscopic type, the size of the aerosol depends on relative humidity. Thin layers of aerosols are observed to persist for a long period of time in some altitudes of the stratosphere. \r\nClouds are global in nature and regularly cover more than 50% of the sky.

Particularly, the main contributors of the incoming solar radiation absorptions are various molecules like the nitrogen (N2), oxygen (O2), ozone (O3), water vapor (H2O). Additionally, other constituents of the atmosphere such as CO2 and CH4, and other trace gases, aerosols, and cloud droplets can also absorb significant portion of the incoming solar radiation. Generally, the absorption of solar radiation is related to the wavelength of the solar spectrum. For example, gases and specific type of aerosols (black carbon, BC) or elementary carbon (EC) absorb in the ultraviolet (UV) and visible (VIS) part of solar spectrum. On the contrary, cloud droplets which are suspended in the atmosphere mainly scatter in UV and VIS and absorb in the infrared. The absorption of the incoming solar radiation from the atmospheric constituents reduces the harmful UV radiation and it is considered as the driving of atmospheric photochemistry. Moreover, scattering in the atmosphere can be divided into two mainly categories, firstly, the Rayleigh scattering which is the scattering of radiation by gases (mainly N2 and O2) and, secondly, the Mie scattering which is the scattering by aerosol particles and cloud droplets. The main difference between Rayleigh and Mie scattering is the direction of the re-emission of the incident solar radiation. For example, in the Rayleigh scattering the light have symmetrical direction either forward or backward whereas in Mie scattering the light is mainly scattered in the forward direction, depending on the size of the particle.",

We can say that, when the particle has a diameter greater than about a tenth of the wavelength, we are in the field of Mie scattering.\r\nThis scattering produces a pattern like an antenna lobe, with a forward lobe sharper and more intense than the back one, the larger the particle size the greater the intensity and sharpness of the anterior lobe. Unlike Rayleigh scattering, Mie scattering is not strongly wavelength dependent. In this case the predominant component for the quantification of scattering (in addition to the particle dimension) is the direction of the incident solar radiation.\r\nMore specifically, the amount of scattering in the backward direction depends upon a wave relation tending to decrease in accordance with the growth of the particle size until it reaches a certain value for which the back scattering becomes a constant quantity. This condition is reached when the diameter of the particle is approximately equal to the wavelength of the incident radiation.\r\nIn the atmosphere the Mie scattering is commonly caused by particles (aerosols) floating in the atmosphere (due to Dust, smoke, fog, rain drop). \r\nIn nature it is possible to see the effects of Mie scattering, for example, in the evenings when there is a lot of fog and the dazzling headlights of our car do not allow us to see the road ahead. \r\nThe Mie theory provides the solution for the amount of scattering in case of a spherical medium due to an incident wave.",

            "description": "Scattering is a physical process by which a particle in the path of an electromagnetic wave continuously exstracts energy from the incident wave and reradiates that energy in all directions. In more detail, it occurs when a photon’s electromagnetic field hits a particle’s electric field in the atmosphere and is deflected into another direction. The Rayleigh scattering falls into the elastic scattering phenomena, in which the individual photon changes its direction of propagation but non its energy. The Rayleigh scattering involves air molecules (mainly N2 and O2) whose diameter (x) is much smaller (one-tenth at least) than the incident radiation wavelength (λ) (i.e., x << λ). The amount of scattered intensity (I) depends on the incident light wavelength (λ) and the refractive index (n) of air molecules. However, the refractive index can be considered relatively negligible as compared to the explicit wavelength term. In this way, the intensity scattered by air molecules in a specific direction is strongly dependent on the wavelength (λ), as expressed in the form Iλ~1/λ4. The inverse dependence of the scattered intensity on the wavelength to the fourth power allows at explaining the blue color of sky, caused by the scattering of sunlight off the atmosphere molecules. To better understand this phenomenon, it is worth considering that a large portion of solar energy is contained between the blue and red regions of the visible spectrum, where blue light (0.425 µm) has a shorter wavelength than red light (0.650 µm). Consequently, based on the above-mentioned equation, blue light scatters about 5.5 times more intensity than red light. For this reason, more blue light is scattered than red, green, and yellow, and so the sky appears blue, when viewed away from the sun’s disk. The Rayleigh scattering of unpolarized sunlight by air molecules has maxima in the forward and backward directions, whereas it shows minima in the side directions. Furthermore, the light scattered by particles is not delimited only on the incidence plane, but is visible in all the azimuthal directions. The derived scattering patterns are symmetrical in the three-dimensional space, because of the spherical symmetry assumed for air molecules.",

Trapping of thermal infrared radiation by atmospheric gases is typical of the atmosphere and is therefore called the “atmospheric effect”. The atmospheric effect is sometimes referred to as the “greenhouse effect” because in a similar way glass, which covers a greenhouse, transmits short-wave solar radiation, however absorbs long-wave thermal infrared radiation. Imagine a beam of radiation travelling through a small section of air. The air is made up of changing concentrations of different species, with all molecules absorbing and emitting thermal radiation at different rates. As the radiation travels through different layers of the atmosphere, the intensity of radiation will constantly be modified by both absorption and emission processes as described by the Schwarzschild's equation. In case of a sensor on board of a satellite, the net radiation measured would be that which is attenuated through each layer (as small increments of absorption and emission) from the surface to the top of the atmosphere plus the radiation emitted directly from the atmosphere. In this case, this process can be described by the radiative transfer equation (RTE). \r\nThe equation of radiative transfer simply says that as a beam of radiation travels through the atmosphere, it loses energy to absorption, gains energy by emission, and redistributes energy by scattering. Many radiative transfer codes exist which are able, i.e. on the basis of known properties of the atmosphere, to computed the effect of the atmosphere on the thermal infrared radiation providing atmospheric transmittance (absorption), atmospheric scattering and atmosphere path emission. Commonly, in satellite remote sensing, the thermal infrared region is defined as the region of the electromagnetic spectrum comprised between 8 and 14 micron. In an atmosphere free of particles (aerosols due to phenomena like fires, volcanic eruption, dust storm, etc.) the thermal infrared radiation is mainly affected by triatomic gases like water vapor, carbon dioxide and ozone.",

Since the linear dimension of the particle is comparable to the wavelength of the radiation, interference effects occur. The most noticeable difference to Rayleigh scattering is, generally, the much weaker wavelength dependence and a strong dominance of the forward direction in the scattered light. The calculation of the Mie scattering cross section, which involves summing over slowly converging series, is complicated even for spherical particles, it is worse for particles of an arbitrary shape.

There are three main spectral ‘windows’ in the Earth's atmosphere. The first of these includes the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) parts of the spectrum up to the medium infrared, between wavelengths of about 0.38 μm and 3.5 μm, although it does also contain a number of opaque regions. This spectral interval includes the small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum to which human eyes are sensitive to (i.e, the visibile region between 0.4 and 0.7 μm). The second is a rather narrow region between about 8 μm and 15 μm, in which is found the bulk of the thermal infrared (TIR) radiation from objects at typical terrestrial temperatures. In this region there is only a main opaque interval, around 9.6 μm due to the presence of the ozone band.

This cycle is vital for Earth’s life, ecosystems, and living organisms. The water cycle includes mainly four processes. Water is evaporated from ocean and land surfaces driven by solar heating. The resulting water vapor rises upwards into the atmosphere, transported by the winds, cools, and due to low air temperature condensates into liquid droplets and ice crystals to form clouds. The ice or/and liquid droplets collide, increase their size, and precipitate as snow or rain to Earth’s surface and oceans. The subtraction of energy (latent heat of evaporation) at low latitudes related to the evaporation processes as well as its release (latent heat of condensation) at higher latitudes related to the condensation processes is a formidable way to guarantees the heat transport from the warmer part of the Earth to the colder ones mantaining local air temperature more compatible with the human life.  The starting point of the water cycle is not unique, but the oceans can be selected as the initial reservoir. Other important reservoirs are considered ice sheets, lakes, and rivers. \r\nThe hydrosphere is defined by the various water reservoirs which are characterized by different residence times – the time spends the water molecules in a reservoir. The water residence time – the rate at which the water comes out the reservoirs – varies for each reservoir extending from hundreds (Greenland Ice Sheet) or thousands of years (Antarctic Ice Sheet) to years and days for rivers and lakes, respectively. It also defines the energy transferred from the Earth to the Atmosphere which increases for short-term residence times. In long-term temporal scales, this energy is defined as the evaporation rate (E) and balances with the precipitation rate (P). This global energy balance breaks for shorter time scales depending also on the local and regional climate. For example, in regions located in the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), the energy balance in the water cycle does not exist since the precipitation rate is much higher than the evaporation rate (P>>E) due to the horizontal movement of converging trade winds.",

In microscale, heat is known as internal energy. Two regions in thermal contact have the same temperature when there is no net exchange of internal energy between them. Heat is the net transfer of internal energy from one region to another, while temperature, which is the degree of hotness or coldness of an object, describes the average kinetic energy of molecules within substances. The faster the particles are moving, the higher their kinetic energy. Since the motion of the particles within an object is random, they do not move at the same speed and in the same direction, some of them move faster. Therefore, those particles have more kinetic energy than the others. Thermodynamic temperature can be defined for substances at (even Local)  Thermodynamic Equilibrium (i.e. in condition of density/pressure which allows an efficient equipartition of kinetic energy among molecules).  Temperature is then the measure of the average kinetic energy of such a system, and is usually expressed in Celsius (°C). When, particular conditions of very low pressure/density (like in the Earth's thermosphere) cannot guarantee energy equipartition among molecules (i.e. outside thermodynamic equilibrium) the concept of Kinetic Temperature should be used instead. The Celsius temperature scale is defined by international agreement in terms of two fixed points: the temperature of the ice point, which is defined as 0° Celsius, and the steam point as 100° Celsius. The Fahrenheit (°F) temperature scale is mainly used in the United States; on this scale, water freezes at 32 degrees Fahrenheit, and the temperature of boiling water is 212 F.

The actual orbit of a satellite will result from a combination of these perturbations. Periodic maneouvers are needed to bring the orbit back to nominal conditions. The lifetime of a satellite is defined as the time interval that it takes to decay from its initial altitude to an altitude causing the satellite reentry down to the atmosphere.

The most important parameters to describe a satellite orbit are the inclination angle i (of the orbit plane respect to the equatorial plane) its eccentricity e and its height H from the Earth's surface. In principle whatever eigth H can be used, provided that the speed of the satellite on its orbit allows the centrigugal force to exactely compensate the gravitational one at that heigth. Polar (i close to 90°) and Geostationary (i=0, H=35.800 km) orbits are the most common choices for EO satellites. In principle one single polar satellite can be sufficient to guarantee the global coverage of the Earth with equal quality of the images at all latitudes. All Geostationary satellites share the same circular orbit with H around 36000 km where the required speed exactely correspond to the one required to travel an entire orbit in 1 sideral day (orbital period P = 1 sideral day). This means that the satellite footprint is permanently in place over a specific Earth's location (e.g. for Meteosat 0°N, 0°E) allowing a quasi-continuous monitoring of a whole Earth's emisphere (with poor visibility of Earth's edges including Poles).  Polar satellites' heigths are usually in between 700-800 km, with orbital periods around 100min (i.e. about 14,5 orbits/day) even if, lower orbits are also chosen particularly for very high spatial resolution payloads. Lower inclinations are also used (quasi-polar orbits) for specific applications. Due to the asphericity (and mass inhomogeneity) of the Earth, satellite orbit plane rotates around the Earth's polar axis with a period Pp producing (for elliptical orbits) the rotation of the orbit itself in its plane. A common choice for most EO polar satellites is to choose the orbital parameters in a way that Pp=1 year (Sun-Synchronous orbits).  Due to the synchronism between Earth's revolution around the Sun and the orbit plane precession around Earth' axis,  satellite passages happens at the same local solar time (similar illumination conditions) each time it flies over a specific region. This ensure repeatable sun illumination conditions facilitating image interpretation particularly for change detection or land monitoring applications. Other choices are possible when it is required to monitor with continuity high latitude regions.\r\n\r\nThis is the case of Molniya orbits which combine the continuity of observations typical of geostationary satellites with the possibility,  offered by polar orbits, to overfly the highest latitudes regions.  Its characteristics are: high eccentricity (e.g. e=0,74, axes 500 and 23.000 km), P=1/2 sideral day (Geo-Synchronous), inclination  (i=63,4° or i=116,6°) which guarantees the satellite footprint at the apogee remaining positioned on a fixed ground point  (non-rotating orbit). This way the satellite will spend more than 93% of its orbital period looking to the same emisphere even from a high latitude point of view.  \r\n\r\nSo called altimetric orbits respond to the specific needs of altimetry. In this case the orbital parameters are chosen in order to guarantee, for example: a) that the ascending and descending sub-satellite tracks intersect at roughly 90 degrees on the Earth’s surface (so that orthogonal components of the surface slope can be determined with equal accuracy; b) the possibility to monitor all phases of tidal effects on ocean surface.\r\n\r\nParticularly important for several applications (multi-temporal analyses, change detection, etc.) are the Exactly repeating orbits.\r\nThey are conceived in order that the sub-satellite track will repeat itself exactly after a certain interval of time. This allows images having the same viewing geometry during the satellite’s lifetime making moreover available a particularly simple method of referring to the location of images (navigation or geo-referenciation)  for example by referring to a ‘path and row’ system used for instance by the Landsat World Reference System (WRS). It is possible to arrange satellite orbits parameters in order to contemporary guarantee the sun-syncronism so that, not only satellite images collected on the same region can be easily super-imposed each-other but the same illumination and viewing geometry can be achieved. This is, for instance, the choice adopted for LANDSAT satellites whose images are typically available as a collection of scene of fixed dimension always similar each other when covering the same terrestrial area.",

For this reason, complex algebra is often used in remote sensing to facilitate phase calculations. Due to its periodic nature, phase can only be measured unambiguously within one period. Consequently, phase measurements are commonly subject to 2π phase ambiguities.

In the presence of Faraday rotation, the data, usually fully polarimetric, should be corrected. The radar systems operate in different bands that uses different wavelengths. The most common frequences/wavelengths (frequency = Speed of Light / wavelength) for environmental applications are X (5,75-10,90 GHz), C-(4,20-5,75 GHz), S-(1,550-4,20 GHz), L-(0,390-1,550 GHz) and P-(0,255-0,390 GHz) band.

More precisely, diffraction describes the phenomena of interaction of waves at an obstacle, such as an aperture, or an opening, such as a hole or an occurring space between two objects. Hence, diffraction is an essential form of scattering, describing ordered scattering at discrete boundaries. The effect of diffraction can be observed through extended interference patterns or simply by the bending of waves. In the field of microwave remote sensing, diffraction has the practical implication that it limits the spatial resolution of a microwave sensor since it acts on the ability of an imaging system to resolve details. This theoretical limit of resolution is called the diffraction limit. This means, the larger the aperture of the observing system compared to its employed wavelength (dependent on the frequency), the finer the resolution of an imaging system. The diffracted field can be calculated with analytical models, such as the Fraunhofer diffraction approximation in case of far field conditions, where the object is far away and the incident waves are assumed to be plane waves, or the Fresnel diffraction approximation in case of near field conditions, where the waves are spherical.\r\nOne simple example of diffraction is the diffraction of sound, for example the possibility to hear sounds around corners.",

Similar to diffraction, scattering refers to the same physical process, the coherent distortion of an incident wave. However, diffraction as well as reflection can be regarded as essentially forms of scattering. Scattering explicitly describes the “random distortion of waves by elements that are similar in size or less than the wavelength” (Woodhouse, 2005). Thereby, scattering of the incident wave at an object can occur in any directions with varying strength, with the scattering pattern varying with the incident direction. Thus, the term scattering cross section, often denoted by σ, quantifies the effectiveness of a scatterer. In the field of active microwave remote sensing, the backscattering coefficient σ0 is known “as the ratio of the statistically, averaged, scattered power density to the average incident power density” (Fung, 1994). \r\nIn passive microwave remote sensing, radiometers measure the intensity of radiation emitted by a body, called brightness temperature TB. Since TB is always less than its physical temperature T, emissivity, defined as e = TB / T, is a measure of how strongly a body radiates at a given wavelength. It varies between 0 (metal) to unity (blackbody).\r\nEmission and scattering are complementary: surfaces that are good scatterers are weak emitters, and vice versa.",

Results show that the sensitivity of measured radar backscatter coefficient decreases with increasing amount or density of present biomass. In the so-called saturation region, the radar backscatter saturates at a biomass depending on the employed wavelength. While for higher frequency bands like C-band (3.95-5.8 GHz), biomass can be measured up to ~50 ton/ha, the amount of measurable biomass increases with decreasing frequency (due to the increasing wavelength), such that at L-band (1-2.6 GHz) ~ 100 ton/ha and at P-band (0.23-1 GHz) ~200 ton/ha biomass can be measured. Further, the sensitivity of radar to biomass is different for co- or cross-polarized backscatter since the level of saturation depends not only on frequency but also on vegetation (e.g., height, structure, density, moisture) and soil surface (e.g., roughness, moisture) parameters. Overall, the saturation of radar backscatter depending on biomass has to be considered when analyzing SAR data.",

The complex relative permittivity of a plant refers to the complex relative dielectric constant of the plant and can be subdivided into complex relative permittivity values for the different plant compartments (roots, stem/stalk, leaves, fruit,...).

Hence, the estimation of one plant permittivity, especially including several plant parts can be challenging to assess, to understand and to model.

Thereby, ξ is defined as displacement between two locations, (x, y) and (x', y') on the surface and given by (1).\r\nWith increasing separation between two locations on the surface p(ξ) decreases, and at a certain distance, the surface correlation length l, the heights at the two locations are considered statistically uncorrelated.\r\nThe surface scattering of electromagnetic waves can be simulated with various models. Depending on the observed roughness scale multiple surface scattering models are valid for specific roughness conditions. For example, one of the first surface scattering models for slightly rough surfaces, the small perturbation model (SPM), deals with roughness scales that are small relative to the wavelength and hence has validity conditions for ks < 0.3, kl < 3, and m < 0.3. Since then, various surface scattering models for computing the scattering and emission behavior of natural surfaces in the microwave region have been proposed, such as the Kirchhoff scattering model (KH), the geometric optics model (GO), the physical optics model (PO), or the integral equation model (IEM), to name the most common used in literature. For simulations of EM scattering at soil surfaces, assumptions of the functional forms of p(ξ) have to be made. The two most common forms for mathematically describing the surface correlation of natural surfaces are the exponential pE(ξ) and the Gaussian pG(ξ) correlation functions, defined by (2) and (3).\r\nFor some mathematically sophisticated surface scattering models, an x-Power correlation function p(x-Power)(ξ) can be assumed (4), with x as value between 1 and 2.\r\nIn literature, rather smooth surfaces are characterized by an exponential surface correlation function, while rather rough surfaces are characterized by a Gaussian surface correlation function.",

The fact that microwaves interact with object at least as big as the wavelength is one of the greatest advantages of microwave remote sensing, since at larger wavelengths atmospheric particles are almost transparent to the signal and microwave sensors are independent from the time of day (day or night) and weather conditions. Water clouds can interfere with the radars operating below 2 cm in wavelength. The effects of rain can be generally ignored at wavelengths above 4 cm. For longer wavelengths (above 20 cm), an effect called Faraday rotation caused by the ionosphere, i.e., free charges (electrons) and the Earth’s magnetic field, can lead to a rotation of the polarization plane.

It applies photogrammetric principles to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. By viewing an object from different positions separated by a baseline, the appeared object position will vary slightly (denoted parallax). The disparities for each position on the object are related to its x-y-z coordinates. In radargrammetry, such disparities are computed for an entire image. The result is the terrain elevation from the measured parallaxes between two (or more) images, acquired at different angles. Radargrammetry requires at least two SAR images acquired from different positions, normally across-track due to the configuration of a side-looking SAR. Same-side stereo-pairs with intersection angles in the range of about 10 – 20° have been a feasible compromise between reasonable geometric disparities and the accuracy of estimated heights. In general, the disparities can be estimated with higher accuracy as the angle of intersection increases (as the stereo exaggeration factor increases). However, the same points must be recognized in all images, and it is hence required that the images are as similar as possible. This improves the image matching and it is best achieved with small intersection angles, which furthermore decreases radiometric differences. \r\nA general procedure for generating an elevation model from stereo-pairs is applicable for radargrammetry when optical stereo images are replaced with the backscatter intensity of SAR images. One image is selected as reference and the other(s) is coarsely registered to the reference, e.g., by using the attached meta-data. The same points are then located in both images using image matching. A common matching criterion is the cross correlation coefficient. Then, spatial point intersections are computed, which is the least square approach to find the intersection points of SAR range circles as defined from the matched image pixels. The computed intersections result in a point cloud that finally is interpolated to a consistent elevation raster. The entire process is extensive and computationally expensive, and normally a dedicated software is required. \r\nRadargrammetry with images acquired from opposite sides have been little investigated, and was first limited to stereoscopic viewing. Some opposite-side research was later presented with limited outcomes under certain conditions. Most applications today will not consider opposite-side radargrammetry, since the alternatives are usually better. Same-side radargrammetry performs better than opposite-side, while interferometric SAR that is based on phase differences, may be even more accurate.

The DInSAR technique relies on the estimation of the deformation of the terrain between the two interfering SAR images (i.e., the so-called master and slave images). To achieve this task, the phase contribution related to the terrain height is simulated and subtracted to the interferometric master/slave phase difference. The obtained differential SAR interferometric phase contains a direct information on the occurred deformation. Once a sequence of interferometric SAR data pairs is selected, the SBAS technique allows generating the time-series of the deformation of the terrain. The processing steps are essentially: i) the extraction of the full phase of the DInSAR interferograms, i.e., the phase unwrapping steps of the DInSAR interferograms, ii) the inversion of the sequence of unwrapped DInSAR phases, iii) the geocoding of the deformation maps from radar coordinates to geographical coordinates.",

Most modern SAR systems are capable of measuring both the intensity and the phase of the reflected signal, where the latter carries information about the distance travelled by the signal. Consequently, the different of phase information of two successive SAR images over a specific area contains a distance information. \r\n\r\nThe phase difference measured between two SAR images is called the interferometric phase. The interferometric phase image is an interferogram. The interferometric phase is a function of the geometry and timing of the individual SAR acquisitions. Different geometric and temporal configurations enable different applications. \r\n\r\nIf the SAR acquisitions are made from different angles and without significant temporal change of the scene, InSAR can be used to create digital elevation models (DEMs) of the Earth, as demonstrated by the NASA/JPL Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). This configuration is called across-track interferometry. If the individual SAR acquisitions are made at different times in the same geometric configuration, i.e. in an along-track or differential interferometric configuration, then InSAR can be used to measure radial velocity of targets and to assess displacements caused by, e.g., volcanoes and earthquakes. The variation of the temporal baseline allows determining velocities ranging from several meters per second to a few millimeters per year. While standard differential interferometry can be used to retrieve changes that happened between two SAR acquisitions, differential interferometric stacking techniques, such as Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) and Small Baseline Subset (SBAS), are used to monitor deformation over a longer period of time by stacking multiple differential interferograms and filtering out the atmospheric phase contribution in order to retrieve very accurate deformation of the ground and its infrastructures.",

Instead of using different positions of the radar sensor along the flight path in order to increase the aperture length, SAR tomography uses multiple passes of the radar sensor over the same area at different elevation positions, i.e. orthogonal to the azimuth-range plane, on different orbits.  Similar to the synthetic aperture in azimuth direction, a larger aperture in cross-range elevation direction allows increasing the resolution in the elevation direction. Therefore, the echoes are focused in the whole 3D space (azimuth, range and elevation), and scattering contributions can be separated at different heights, even if they are situated in the same azimuth-range cell.\r\nSAR tomography exploits therefore these multiple passes of the radar sensor at different orbit positions (orbits heights) in order to retrieve 3D information about volumetric targets, where the 2D SAR signals often overlaps due to the typical side-looking geometry. \r\nThe result of tomographic processing is a tomogram, i.e. it is a hologram of a specific area of interest, usually represented as a tomographic profile along a particular direction. Using polarimetric data, the different scattering mechanisms happening at different heights can be represented in the profile, allowing a full understanding of the volumetric information and backscattering processes.\r\nUnlike the azimuthal aperture, the tomographic aperture is achieved by repeat-pass acquisitions, the antenna having to come back over the area. An important parameter is therefore the target coherence, that may decrease by longer repeat-pass cycles. In general, a 1-4 day revisit cycle is preferred for tomographic applications.\r\nSAR tomography finds applications in the imaging and monitoring of cities and single buildings, as well as in height and biomass estimation of forest stands. The use of longer wavelength that guaranty the penetration into canopy volumes allows a better retrieval of the complete forest structure and its undergrowth.",

The incidence angle to the ellipsoid corresponds to the angle between the incident radar beam and the normal to the local ellipsoid, regardless of the local slope and terrain. \r\n\r\nFor a flat surface and neglecting the Earth’s curvature, the incidence angle corresponds to the angle between the incident radar beam and the vertical, and it equals the look angle of the sensor, which characterizes the angle between the nadir view and the radar beam.

Depending on the considered sensor and acquisition modes, variations of the incidence angle up to 20° can be observed between near and far range.\r\n\r\nThe incidence angle has an influence on the radar backscatter intensity. Considering a surface with diffuse reflection, increasing incidence angles lead to decreasing backscatter intensities. This effect is less pronounced for rough than for smooth surfaces. A change in incidence angle may also induce a change in the occurring backscattering mechanisms or geometric distortions of the image. For example, for high incidence angles, terrain distortion due to the side-looking geometry is reduced.

SAR spatial resolution is determined individually in the two principal SAR image directions: ground range and azimuth (along-track).  Ground range resolution for a SAR system is derived from slant range (across-track) resolution, by projecting it onto the ground surface using the incident angle, i.e., the angle between the line-of-sight and the ground surface normal. It is thus range-dependent, with finer resolution available in far range. Assuming adequate signal processing, slant range resolution of a SAR system is proportional to the speed of light and inversely proportional to the system bandwidth, i.e., the width of the used frequency interval. This caused by the fact that each individual frequency provides an independent measurement of the slant range, so a larger bandwidth implies more independent measurements contributing to the final slant range estimate. Similar principles apply to the azimuth direction. Assuming adequate signal processing, the SAR azimuth resolution is proportional to the along-track velocity of the SAR sensor and inversely proportional to the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of the system. A lower interval between the consecutive pulses (higher PRF) results in better azimuth resolution due to faster sampling, but at the cost of range ambiguities occurring when echoes from one pulse are recorded after the next pulse has been transmitted.",

Whereas a flat terrain only appears more compressed in near range and more stretched in far range, larger geometric distortions appear for terrain with more topography (e.g. mountains) or high objects (e.g. trees, buildings).

RADAR is an acronym for RAdio Detection And Raging. An active radar system sends out pulses and records the echoes scattered back by the objects (scatterers) to the sensor. The systems use the two-way travel time of the radar pulse to determine the distance (range) to the illuminated object. Its backscatter intensity is determined by the radar system and object properties and depends on the quantity of energy coming back to the sensor. Active radar systems transmit a signal and record the amount of energy that is scattered back and depends of both dielectric and geometric properties.  Passive radiometers record microwave energy, which is emitted by the Earth’s surface.\r\nDepending on the type of system, microwave remote sensing can be used in multiple applications. Active sensors are principally used for diverse land cover mapping applications based on the particular backscattering mechanisms and characteristics of the objects on the Earth’s surface.

            "description": "Remote sensing, i.e. the process of obtaining information about an object or area from a distance, is not possible without remote sensing sensors that collect this information and the platforms on which the sensors are installed and which are used to move them. Remote sensing sensors collect data by detecting energy that is reflected or emitted from Earth. There are different types of remote sensing sensors. The interaction between the sensor and the Earth's surface has two modes: active or passive. Passive sensors use solar radiation to illuminate the Earth's surface and detect reflection from the surface or measure the emitted energy. They usually record electromagnetic waves in the visible (˜430–720 nm) and near infrared (NIR) (˜750–950 nm) through short infrared (SWIR) (˜1.500-2.500 nm) to thermal infrared (TIR) (8.000-14.000 nm) ranges. The power measured by passive sensors is a function of surface composition, physical temperature, surface roughness and other physical properties of the Earth. Active sensors provide their own energy source to illuminate objects and measure their properties. These sensors use electromagnetic waves in the visible and near infrared range (e.g.laser altimeter) and radar waves (e.g. synthetic aperture radar (SAR)). As sensor technology has advanced, the integration of passive and active sensors into one system has emerged. Alternatively, remote sensing sensors can be classified into imaging sensors, i.e. that produce an image of an area, within which smaller parts of the sensor's whole view are resolved (pixels), and non-imaging sensors, i.e. that return a signal based on the intensity of the whole field of view. In terms of their spectral characteristics, the imaging sensors include optical imaging sensors, thermal imaging sensors, and radar imaging sensors. These sensors can be on satellites, mounted on aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV),  drone or ground. The collected information can be transformed into an image or set of points (e.g. cloud points), which can be further processed and analyzed to obtain the necessary information, e.g. agricultural field development phase, level of air pollution, etc.\r\nA digital imagery of Earth observation sensors is a two-dimensional representation of objects on Earth. Current images collected from different levels of acquisition, from ground to satellite, with the help of electronic sensors are examples of digital images. There are different aspects and characteristics of remote sensing data and images, such as, for example, data formats and processing levels, data storage, data properties.",

            "description": "Remote sensing sensors has its roots in the 19th century in the development of photography. Photography was an invention that made it possible to acquire a permanent image. The first photographic image was taken in 1826 by Joseph Nicephore Nieppce. While the first aerial photograph was taken in 1858 by Felix Tournachon, known as Nadar, from a tethered baloon over Biévre Valley in France. In 1907 Julius Neubronner developed a light miniature camera that could be fitted to a pigeon's breast. It can be said that the construction camera + pigeon was the precursor of today's unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) or drone. Further developments focused on developing new sensors (analog vs. digital frame cameras) and how to save and store images (e.g. photographic emulsions, films). The origin of other types of remote sensing can be traced to World War II, with the development of radar, sonar, and thermal infrared detection systems. Since the 1960s, sensors were designed to operate in virtually all of the electromagnetic spectrum. Both civil and military aerial photography have long been widely used in cartography to create maps. Specialized large format cameras (looking vertically down, assuming the plane is flying horizontally) were developed. Such cameras have been specially designed to perform almost vertical sequences of bird-eye exposures during aircraft flight. Hence for a long time remote sensing consisted of aerial photography and photogrammetry using analogue mechanical or optical equipment. Everything has changed with satellites and the space race. The first real success of remote sensing satellites in serious scientific work was in meteorology, weather satellite TIROS-1, launched by NASA on April 1, 1960. \r\nToday a wide variety of remote sensing instruments are available as data source for use in different applications for land, water and atmosphere monitoring.",

The scanners are mounted on space- or aircrafts. \r\nA two-dimensional image is created (line by line) by exploiting the platform motion along the orbital track. The data are collected along track using a linear array of detectors arranged perpendicular to the direction of travel. The array of detectors are pushed along the flight direction to scan the successive scan lines, and hence the name pushbroom scanner. \r\nThere are no moving parts on a pushbroom sensor, hence, the scanning speed can be increased compared to across track systems. A longer dwell time over each ground resolution cell increases the signal strength (high radiometric resolution, no pixel distortion). Additionally, finer spatial and spectral resolution can be achieved as the size of the ground resolution cell is determined by the Instantaneous Field of View (IFOV) of a single detector. The systems are designed for high-resolution imaging. However, a very large number of detectors is needed for high resolution images. It is a complex optical system. In addition, the pushbroom scheme requires a wide Field of View (FOV) optics system to obtain the same swath as for a corresponding whiskbroom (across track) scanner. It has narrow swath width.     \r\nThe detector arrays with such a line-scanning pushbroom system are usually of the type Charge-Coupled Device (CCD).\r\nThe MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) on board the Sentinel-2 satellite (Copernicus mission) uses a pushbroom concept.\r\nMultispectral imaging systems building the final image (line by line) exploiting the platform motion along the orbital track.

Contrary to passive sensors, who detect naturally occurring radiation, active sensors emit radiation and collect and analyze the signal that is sent back by the Earth’s surface or atmosphere. Active remote sensing systems produce therefore their own electromagnetic energy. They transmit and receive the radiation that is reflected or backscattered from the illuminated target. They do not necessitate an external source of radiation (e.g. Sun or Earth). Contrary to most passive sensors that are bound to detecting either the reflected Sun radiation or emitted radiation by the Earth’s surface in ranges from the ultraviolet to the thermal infrared, active sensors can use any radiation from the electromagnetic spectrum, the only limitation being the transparency of the Earth’s atmosphere.

Imaging radars are independent of weather conditions and can operate day or night. It uses microwave wavelengths, radar bands from X- to P- or VHF-band, in four polarisations to illuminate an area on the ground. Normally only the horizontal (H) or vertical (V) linear polarizations are used. The radar system is characterized by combination of polarization of transmitted and received pulse: HH, HV, VH or VV. A typical radar system measures the strength and roundtrip time of the microwave signals that are emitted by a radar antenna and reflected off a target area. An imaging radar is therefore both and imaging and a ranging system. The illuminated objects are mapped in the radar depending on their backscatter intensity and respective range to the sensor.\r\nImaging radar can be mounted on aircraft or satellite. It operates in a side-looking configuration, left or right with reference to the flight direction. This acquisition geometry allows the distinct mapping of scatterers corresponding to their respective distance to the sensor. It causes also geometric distortions in the radar image, i.e., relief displacement (foreshortening and layover) and shadow. The radar sensor operates not in the real aperture of the radar antenna, i.e., real spatial width, radar (RAR) mode but in the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mode. Synthetic aperture is possible to set up through the forward motion of the spacecraft, which enables to “extend” the real size of the radar antenna.

It is the simplest application of the LIght Detection And Ranging technique. It transmits a short pulse of energy (visible or near-infrared radiation) and detects 'echo', by measuring the time delay. Knowing the speed of propagation of the pulse (speed of light), the range from the instrument to the surface can be measured.\r\nLaser profiling uses successive reflectorless laser range measurements (1D distance measurement) on adjacent points along a path, which results in a 2D profile or cross-section of the ground. A laser profiler can be terrestrial, or ground-based, or it can be mounted on an airborne or spaceborne platform. In the case of ground-based measurements, the platform is fixed but the angle of illumination changes, allowing for the cross section of the terrain to be mapped. An airborne laser profiler can transmit a continuous stream of pulses along its flight path. As a result, if the position of the platform is known, e.g. from GPS/IMU system, a surface profile along the flight path can be reconstructed using the successively recorded vertical distances between the platform and the points on the ground. The use of an additional rotational mirror allow to scan the Earth in an additional dimension, providing 3D information of the mapped surface. This is the principle of a laser scanner.\r\nThere are two principal types of laser profiling techniques: the first one is based on analog detection and the second on photon counting. In analog detection, the signal power is converted into an output voltage providing a signal strength as function of time. The analog-to-digital conversion yields either a full waveform that allows retrieving the entire time-structure of the return signal strength- and therefore the full vertical structure of the target-, or discrete returns when the signal strength exceed a certain threshold. The full waveform information is especially useful when analyzing vegetation, as every vegetation layer (canopy, stems, branches) and the ground return pulses, allowing the determination of e.g. canopy height, ground surface topography but also a deeper analysis of the canopy structure. Photon counting techniques record the arrival of single photons. The counting of photons is combined with their time-of-flight. The accumulation of single photons at a specific range is similar to the signal strength of analog detection and allows retrieving the height and structure of specific targets.\r\ne can be measured.",

Radar altimeters operate similar to laser profilers. Both emit a short pulse of electromagnetic radiation towards the Earth’s surface and detect the time delayed echo. By measuring the time delay and knowing the speed of propagation of the pulse, the range (distance) from the instrument to the surface can be determined. By using the forward motion of the altimeter platform and transmitting a continuous stream of pulses a profile can be built up. If the exact location of the platform as a function of time is known, a surface profile can be generated. \r\nFor a high accuracy of the range resolution, a narrow antenna beam is required, which can be achieved either by using large antennas or short radar beams. In the first case, the radar altimeter is beam-limited; in the second case it is pulse-limited. As large antennas are not practical in space, pulse-limited systems are used for space-borne platforms. Pulse-limited altimeters use frequency modulated (chirp) pulses generated by a chirp generator. The accuracy of the measurements also depends on atmospheric transmission effects, as the speed of the electromagnetic radiation traveling at the speed of light will be delayed when passing through the ionosphere and the atmosphere twice. In general, the range resolution of radar altimeters is in the order of a few centimetres. \r\nIn the beginning, radar altimeters were used for measurements of surface profiles of the ocean topography to get information about currents, ocean circulation, wind and waves.

In particular, spaceborne laser profiler are of high interest for studying surface roughness of ice sheets or for mapping desert topography. Furthermore, spaceborne laser profilers are also useful in atmospheric science for retrieving cloud structure and analyzing different aerosol layers. The requirements for airborne and spaceborne laser altimeters are different. In particular, for spaceborne altimeters, both the distance travelled by the laser pulse and the platform speed are much higher than for airborne instruments, inducing the need of larger optics and more powerful laser instruments. First spaceborne laser experiments were conducted onboard the space shuttle in the mid-1990s, first aiming atmospheric research with a near infrared laser. After successful trial, the space shuttle laser altimeter was fine-tuned and follow-up missions focused on mapping terrain relief and vegetation canopies. Later missions, such as GLAS (IceSAT), ATLAS (IceSAT-2) and GEDI (ISS), used either near-infrared or green (or both) laser light and focused on improving ground coverage while allowing smaller footprints of the laser beam on ground.

This results in adjacent, slightly overlapping stripes, or sub-swaths along the range direction, parallel to the azimuth direction, each stripe having a different incidence angle at its center.

Therefore, each stripe is illuminated for a shorter time as for the StripMap mode, leading to a degradation of the azimuth resolution.

The timing is adjusted though, such that the time-varying antenna footprint repeat cyclically. Similar to the other acquisition modes, the achievable resolution and coverage of ScanSAR products depends on the considered sensor and its properties. For X-Band, e.g. for TerraSAR-X, a total swath width of 100 km in range direction can be achieved using four adjacent sub-swaths or, using a Wide ScanSAR mode with six adjacent sub-swaths, a swath width up to 270 km can be achieved.

Satellites that orbit in a medium (mid) Earth orbit include navigation and specialty satellites, designed to monitor a particular region. Most scientific satellites, including NASA’s Earth Observing System fleet, have a low Earth orbit. On which orbit a satellite will be launched to, depends mainly on its application. The orbit types can be categorized according to their height.\r\nThe orbit height of a satellite corresponds to the distance between the Earth’s surface and the satellite. It determines its speed as it rotates around the Earth. Due to Earth’s gravity, the pull of gravity is stronger for lower orbits than for higher orbits. Therefore, a satellite situated on a lower orbit will circle the Earth faster than a satellite situated on a higher orbit.\r\n\tHigh Earth orbit: it describes orbits situated at about 36000 km above the Earth’s surface (42164 km from the Earth’s center). At this exact distance, the speed of the satellite on the orbit matches the Earth’s rotation, i.e. the satellite needs 24 hours to complete a full rotation on the orbit, when the orbit is situated exactly above the equator. Such orbits are also called geosynchronous orbits, as the satellite moves at the same speed than the Earth and seems to stay in place over a specific location. Those orbits are mainly used for weather and communication satellites\r\n\tMedium Earth orbit: it describes orbits situated at about 20200 km of the Earth’s surface, or 26560 km of the Earth’s center. At this height, a satellite rotates twice around the orbit during one Earth’s rotation. This orbit is also called semi-synchronous and this is the orbit type used by Global Navigation Satellite Systems such as GPS and GLONASS. A further important medium Earth orbit is the Molniya orbit which allows the observation of the poles, otherwise nearly impossible with equatorial geosynchronous orbits.\r\n\tLow Earth orbit: this type of orbits are used from almost all dedicated scientific Earth Observation satellites. Most of them use a particular, nearly polar orbit inclination, meaning that the satellite rotates around the Earth nearly from pole to pole (instead of around the equator as it is the case for geosynchronous satellites). This rotation takes about 99 minutes, depending of the specific orbit inclination. During one half of the orbit, the satellite views the daytime side of the Earth, i.e. the illuminated side. At the pole, satellite crosses over and views the nighttime side of Earth. Back to the daylight side, the satellite can view the area adjacent to the region flown over in the last orbit path, due to the simultaneous Earth’s rotation. In 24 hours, satellites situated on these orbits view almost all the Earth twice, for optical satellites once in daylight and once in the dark. Radar satellites seen each Earth region twice, from two different illumination directions. These specific polar-orbits are called sun-synchronous, as the local solar time stays the same each time a satellite flies over a specific region. This has the advantage of providing an almost constant angle of sunlight for each region on the Earth’s surface viewed by the satellite over time and ensure repeatable sun illumination conditions; the angle will only vary seasonally due to the Earth revolution around the sun. Due to this consistency, images of a specific region would not show much illumination changes due to shadows or sunlight and image interpretation over time such as change detection or monitoring approaches are possible. Because a sun-synchronous orbit does not pass directly over the poles, there is a data gap over both poles where no data is acquired.",

            "description": "An imaging SAR system can generally make acquisitions in different modes. Which acquisition mode to choose depends of the application but also on the desired coverage and data resolution. Even if technically all acquisitions modes can be used everywhere on the Earth’s surface, specific modes are preferred for ocean applications that are different from the ones used in land applications.\r\nThe different acquisition modes can be defined either by their geometrical or by their temporal properties.\r\nThe geometrical properties refer to the geometric configuration of the SAR antenna. Usually looking sideways down in a direction perpendicular to the flight direction (Stripmap mode), the antenna can also be steered around the nadir axis in order to look at a specific target for a longer time during pass-by (Spotlight mode). This configuration allows to rachieve higher azimuth resolution but reduces coverage. It is rather used for very local application where a precise information about specific targets is needed. Other geometric configurations steer the antenna around the flight direction (ScanSAR mode), yielding to a larger swath on the ground. The distance between near and far range is increased, as well as the range of incidence angles within one acquisition. Whereas it increases the area of the scene, it comes generally with a decrease of the spatial resolution in the azimuth direction. Depending on the sensors, the name of the acquisition modes as well as particular technical properties can differ. Sentinel-1 uses a TOPS configuration (Terrain observation with Progressive Scan), which combines the antenna steering properties of both ScanSAR and Spotlight modes. \r\nThe temporal properties refer for specific techniques to the time interval between several acquisitions of the same area. Either these acquisitions are taken simultaneously in one pass over the area of interest (single-pass), or they are taken at different times, needing several passes over the area (repeat-pass).\r\nSpecific SAR techniques such as InSAR and Tomography, while relying on those geometric and temporal properties, have additional acquisition configuration characteristics. For example, the interferometric mission TanDEM-X has three acquisition modes defined by the number of satellite emitting or receiving the signal (pursuit monostatic mode, bistatic mode, alternating bistatic mode), which allows phase referencing. Tomographic SAR uses multi-baseline observations, i.e. the antenna passes several times over an area but at different heights, allowing via different incidence angles the retrieval of structural information of specific targets.",

For this purpose, consecutive measurements of total incident solar irradiance and of radiance or irradiance upwelling from the target are collected by an operator, or more recently by new instruments for long-term and unattended field spectroscopy measurements. The incident irradiance is usually computed by measuring the radiance upwelling from a white calibrated panel which represents the ideal Lambertian surface. Upwelling fluxes are instead usually collected holding the sensor vertically over the surface (nadir view), although spectral libraries collected observing the target from different viewing angles are also available. \r\nField spectrometry is also referred to as ‘proximal sensing’ to underline that spectra are collected with portable spectroradiometers in the vicinity of the target, in contrast to ‘remote sensing’, which is instead usually performed with satellite or airborne sensors.\r\nField spectroscopy is therefore an in-situ method for characterising the reflectance of natural or artificial surfaces and thereby provides reference data for the calibration or validation (cal/val) of airborne and satellite sensors. This method provides a means of scaling-up measurements from small areas (e.g. leaves, rocks) to composite scenes (e.g. vegetation canopies), and ultimately to pixels.\r\nField spectroscopy is used in different applications, for example, soils, rocks, vegetation and chlorophyll fluorescence, water, snow surfaces and atmosphere. Long-lasting field spectroscopy campaigns based on manual measurements are extremely resource-demanding and do not ensure repeatability of the acquisition conditions as the instrument setup is initialized each day. To overcome such limitations a few research groups have initiated automatic tower-based spectral reflectance measurements using different devices. With such setups, non-imaging spectrometers are installed in the field and are operated automatically for long periods (i.e. months to years) and different networks of hyperspectral instruments are now becoming operational (e.g. RadCal Net).\r\nField spectroscopy can be also used to predict optimum spectral bands, viewing configuration, spectral calibration and time to perform a particular remote sensing task but also to develop, refine and test models relating biophysical attributes to remotely-sensed data. In this context, ground reflectance measurements are therefore mainly used as input in simulation study for sensor design, calibration/validation data for remote sensing sensors, for spectral mixture analysis and for the development of relationships between field data and radiometric variables.\r\nSince spectroscopy is the study of matter using electromagnetic radiation,  point or imaging field spectrometers are instruments which allow the measurements of reflected or emitted electromagnetic radiation. In particular, portable or hand-held spectroradiometers are small instruments that spectrally measure the radiation reflected or emitted by a target and they are useful in obtaining accurate spectral data over different surfaces. In remote sensing, they generally cover the 400-2500 nm spectral range and operate with a full width at half-maximum of about 1.5/3 nm, so that they can collect radiation in a continuous way across the spectrum. The final output is therefore the hyperspectral signature of reflectance of the surfaces versus the considered wavelength.",

It can be considered as an array of numbers that can be stored and handled by a digital computer. The picture elements are pixels and each pixel has a specific value (usually in grayscale). This value is a digital number (DN), which usually represents the amount of energy recorded by the sensor at this pixel position or any other characteristic recorded by the sensor, e.g. elevation. \r\nEach row of the image grid, or matrix, corresponds to one scan line. Each pixel is characterized by its row r and column c position in the image, as well as by its value. Additional geographical information is needed in order to assign a geographic location to a pixel. The digital number are integers usually compressed in one byte (= 8 bit) representation, i.e. each pixel can take 256 values.\r\nDigital images are raster data, as opposite to vector data. Whereas vector data can be points, lines or polygones, raster data always consist of pixels. A pixel is the smallest element in which an image can be divided into. The pixel size varies depending of the instrument and of the sampling used. Large pixel may contain information about several objects of the recorded scene. However, they only have one value. These are called mixed-pixel, as e.g. several land cover classes are represented within one pixel and they cannot be distinguished from another. \r\nIn multispectral imagery, each region of the electromagnetic spectrum is recorded in an independent image (band). Therefore, at a specific array position (r,c), there exist several pixels, each with a specific value corresponding to the energy recorded for the considered band. This result in a three-dimensional matrix. The bands of a multispectral image can be displayed three at a time in the computer using for each band one of the three primary colors red, green and blue (RGB). This is called a color composite image. If the color composite represents a combination of the visible red, green and blue bands in their respective color, the combination is called natural or true color composite, as it corresponds to what the human eye sees naturally.

The size of this area is called resolution cell and characterizes the spatial resolution of the sensor. Depending on the spatial resolution, whole features of the Earth’s surface can be detected homogeneously in one or several resolution cells. For features smaller than the spatial resolution, the average reflected radiation of all features within a resolution cell is recorded, leading to so-called mixed-pixels.\r\nFor imaging active systems, the spatial resolution is dependent of both the length of the transmitted pulse in looking direction and the width of the radiation beam or the antenna width in flight direction.\r\nIn all cases, the spatial resolution indicates the level of detail observable in an image. Usually, one distinguishes between coarse (low), moderate (medium) and fine (high and very high) resolution, whereby the use of this denomination is often context-dependent. Sensors with coarse resolution can only detect large features, but they usually cover a much larger area than high-resolution sensors, which can provide detailed information on small objects such as individual buildings, trees or cars, but for much smaller areas. Coarse spatial resolution mean in general a resolution cell larger than 250 m and a scene extent of several thousands of kilometers (>1000 km). Moderate resolution sensors have a spatial resolution of 30 m to 80 m, and a coverage of approximately 200 km in a single acquisition.

Most common satellite optical imagery are available in three distinct processing levels, from level 0 to level 2. The most used processing levels are level 1 and level 2, depending on the user and the application. \r\nIn Level 0, the raw data are processed in a way that they are ready to be archived. Processing operations generally includes telemetry analysis, error detections and granule concatenation. Furthermore, relevant parameters such as acquisition date and geographical reference are annotated in the form of metadata, this information being necessary for processing higher levels. Additionally, a quicklook of the image is generated. No correction is performed at this level.\r\nLevel 1 is often divided in several sublevels. Generally, both radiometric correction and geometric refinement are performed at this level. The radiometric processing includes several radiometric corrections such as dark signal correction or spectral band binning. The radiometric correction allows the determination of physical variables (e.g. reflectance) from the digital numbers. The geometric processing includes tiles association and resampling grid computation, in order to link for each image band its native image geometry to the target geometry. The result of this processing steps is usually a geocoded, Top of Atmosphere product.\r\nLevel 2 data usually consist of atmospherically corrected Level 1 data, i.e. Bottom-of-Atmosphere data. These surface reflectance products may be accompanied by additional outputs, such as scene classification, water vapor or surface temperature maps.\r\nFor specific applications and sensors, Level 3 application ready data are available. These are derivated products such as burned area, dynamic surface water content and snow cover maps.\r\nDepending on the considered sensor and level, the name of the sublevels can differ: Sentinel 2 defines Level-1B as radiometrically corrected data. Level 1C are radiometrically and geometrically corrected data, i.e Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) orthoimage products. Landsat sensors distinguish between Terrain precision correction (L1TP), systematic Terrain Correction (L1GT) and Geometric systematic Correction (L1GS) depending on the quality of the reference data for geometric correction.

Level 0 data are principally used for research in the topic of signal processing. As for optical data, level 0 product are annotated with several metadata, such as calibration and orbit information, and acquisition time and date.\r\nLevel 1 data can be separated in two distinct product types, depending if the full complex information is used (amplitude and phase) or only the amplitude information. The product denomination depends on the sensor type; for Sentinel 1 the names Single Look Complex (SLC) and Ground range detected (GRD) are used, respectively. Both products can be generated from the Level 0 data. Level 1 data are the products that are used by most scientific users. The processing toward Level-1 data includes Doppler centroid estimation and data focusing. The Level 1 SLC product consists of the real and imaginary part of focused complex SAR data in slant range geometry, from which the phase and amplitude information can be retrieved. This is available for all acquired polarisations. Additional orbit information for georeferencing is provided with the data.  The Level 1 GRD data consist of focused and multi-looked SAR data that have been projected to ground range geometry. GRD data only contain amplitude information, therefore the phase information is lost. The multi-looking step is particular for GRD data and allows both speckle reduction and square pixel resolution. As for the SLC data, the GRD data are annotated with orbit information for georeferencing. The Level-1 products are not calibrated, they include however information about calibration constants, which are sensor dependent. Further processing is needed in order to obtain calibrated radar cross section information from the original data intensity values.\r\nLevel 2 products describe geolocated derivated geophysical products such as ocean wind field or surface radial velocity. Such products are for example available for download on the Sentinel-1 Copernicus Hub. Further Level- 2 data are for example differential interferograms or change maps, which can be processed on different online platforms (e.g. Hyp3) and provide information about surface deformation or more generally changes between several acquisitions.\r\nThe denomination of the product types on the different levels may differ from sensor to sensor, but the processing steps stay almost the same, depending additionally on the considered acquisition modes.

The processing level is a mean of describing how much the raw data have been processed toward an informational geophysical product. The degrees of data processing usually follow a numerical hierarchy and typically range from Level 0 (less processed) up to Level 4 (highly processed). They characterize the type of data processing that has been performed between the raw data and the current product.\r\nA first effort for providing standard definitions of different processing levels has been made in the 1980s by the Committee on Data Management and Computation (CODMAC) of the National Research Council (NRC). CODMAC identified eight levels of processing, applicable for all space science data. Starting with the raw data at level 1, the degree of processing and complexity of the data increased at each new level. Level 2 describes edited data, corrected for obvious instrumentation errors and tagged with acquisition time and location; Level 3 stays for calibrated data where values are proportional to a specific physical unit. Level 4 represents resampled data, Level 5 derived data, where specific geophysical information has been retrieved and mapped based on the original data. Level 6 represents all ancillary data (i.e. instrument data) that are necessary for the previous steps of calibration and resampling. Level 7 describes so called correlative data: not directly belonging to the original data, those data represent all other science data that where necessary for the interpretation of the original spaceborne dataset. Finally, Level 8 are user description, i.e. documentation of the data.\r\nConcerning spaceborne image data, both optical and radar, an adaptation of these original levels has been made from NASA and NOAA that is used for the main current spaceborne missions, including the Copernicus program. Whereas specific adaptations may arise for specific sensors and sensor types, there are five principal processing levels. Level 0 represents the raw data that have just been edited for the correction of artifacts.  Level 1 data are Level 0 data with additional annotations regarding time and geolocation information, radiometric and geometric calibration coefficients (for example Top of Atmosphere data for optical imagery). Level 2 data are already radiometrically and geometrically calibrated and represent physical variables (for example Bottom of Atmosphere data for optical imagery).  Level 3 data correspond to derived variables and information (e.g. land cover) with completeness and consistency information, e.g. quality flags. Level 4 represent higher level data resulting from modelling or more complex analysis of the data with additional ancillary information.\r\nFor many applications and users, so called analysis ready data (ARD data) are required.

By extension, this community includes students and supportive deans and other educational administrators.  The benefits that these users gain from EO information includes a set of best practices vetted by experts in the field that they can use to teach modern GIS workflows more effectively.  \r\nThe goals of this user community are focused on a deeper and a broader implementation of geotechnology, methods, and spatial data throughout the educational system—primary, secondary, university, and lifelong learning (libraries, museums, and other informal settings).   Deeper implementation implies embracing GIS as a platform, including its field data gathering tools and citizen science workflows, spatial analysis, building web maps and apps, communicating with multimedia maps derived from web GIS, systems configuration work, and the coding that is behind modern GIS infrastructure.   Broader implementation implies the use of GIS in a multitude of disciplines at all levels of education, formal and informal; occurring wherever changes over space and time are being examined.  \r\nAt all levels of education the challenge of sufficient bandwidth and the use of a professional systems-based tool such as GIS, along with devices capable of running web GIS tools, are barriers in many areas throughout the world.  However, educational and societal forces represent a stronger challenge than technological ones.  These educational and societal challenges that this user community faces include the lack of educational content standards at the primary and secondary level that support the use of geotechnologies in education, and at the university level, a lack of awareness of and access to modern SaaS GIS tools and open data portals.   \r\nThe risks that the community faces in not facing the challenge of the use of GIS in the education sector is a lack of geographic and spatial literacy among students and faculty.  This will translate to research that does not consider spatiotemporal implications of 21st Century challenges, a workforce ill-equipped to deal with them, and consequently an increasingly unstable and dysfunctional world.  To build a workforce that can meet global challenges in energy, biodiversity, climate, natural resources, natural hazards, human health, economic inequality, and others, a deep and wide implementation of GIS technology and methods must take place throughout the educational system.  The actions that society can take to face that challenge is to provide professional development opportunities for faculty, curricular resources, assessment instruments, relevant spatial data and open data portals, examples of best practices, and a network for educators and researchers in which to interact.  EO can provide all of these elements in partnership with educational institutions, government, nonprofits, and industry to meet this challenge.

Timely, continuous, and independent data on the atmosphere is useful in various domains like health, agriculture, renewable energies, urban planning, climate sciences and biology.\r\nThe atmosphere composition includes greenhouse gases (GHG) like carbon dioxide, methane, NO2 and SO2. They are part of the Earth system and have a strong impact on the climate. To monitor changes in atmosphere composition enables modelling climate change and understanding the impact of human-induced emissions of GHG relative to natural sources. EO-derived products include inventory of emission data as an input to atmospheric chemistry transport models and forecast models. Inventories are based on a combination of existing data sets and new information, describing emissions from fossil fuel use, ships, volcanoes, and vegetation. This ensures good consistency between the emissions of greenhouse gases, reactive gases, and aerosol particles and their precursors.\r\nAir quality describes the composition of the atmosphere from gases and particles near the Earth's surface. Local emissions from different sources (e.g. energy production, industrial production, traffic) cause changes to the atmospheric composition that are highly variable in space and time. The quality of the air we breathe can significantly impact our health and the environment. Therefore, it is highly relevant to monitor air quality and emissions. EO satellites are capable of monitoring aerosols, tropospheric O3, tropospheric NO2, CO, HCHO, SO2, and particulate matter (of the sizes PM 2.5 and PM 10). Products like air quality assessment reports, daily ozone forecasts, and UV-index forecast maps are produced that are applied in specific use cases, particularly related to health.\r\nThe amount of solar radiation that arrives at a location on the Earth surface depends on the atmosphere composition and varies over the day and the seasons. Information on solar radiation is useful in various domains. Applications of sunlight and ozone data are for example real-time UV radiation forecasting and risk assessment, skin health services, climate change studies, assessment of ozone protection policies effectiveness, plant growth and disease control, evaporation and irrigation models, power generation, solar heating systems planning and monitoring.",

This imbalance results in a change in the globally-averaged temperature. Amongst the contributors of positive climate forcing, that leads to an increase in the globally-averaged temperature, the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmospheric composition is considered to be the most important factor. Changes in the carbon dioxide concentration indicate that the exchanges between carbon sources and sinks are not balanced. It can be shown that human-induced emissions of carbon dioxide are responsible for the increase of the carbon dioxide since the industrialisation.\r\nWith EO, we can monitor changes in greenhouse gases (GHG), aeorosols, albedo, and solar radiation. The dynamic nature of the climate makes it necessary to apply equally dynamic EO monitoring that allows to deliver key information on historical, seasonal forecast and projection periods for climate-related indicators.\r\nRelevant EO products include estimates of the climate forcing of aerosol, ozone and greenhouse gases. The dynamic nature of the climate makes it necessary to apply equally dynamic EO monitoring that allows to deliver key information on historical, seasonal forecast and projection periods for climate-related indicators. \r\nThe products are particularly relevant to the European energy sector in terms of electricity demand and the production of power from wind, solar and hydro sources. \r\nMoreover, water management uses EO-derived information about climate change to mitigate effects of changing precipitation patterns to adapt their strategies, and to prepare for climate variability and change in the water sector, e.g. because of changes in river discharge, droughts and floods.\r\nFinally, insurance uses climate change information for assessing the weather risks to insured assets that change with the climate-related increase in extreme weather conditions.

To forecast the weather is a major branch in the field of meteorology. In comparison to climate, weather can only be predicted for a short period of time (minutes to month), because it describes the state of the atmosphere for specific days at specific locations. For a reliable weather forecast, a good numerical prediction model with precise initial conditions is needed. Models are sensitive to changes in the initial condition, that is why at the moment weather predictions are only accurate for few days. However, both models and the determination of initial conditions are steadily improved. EO makes a significant contribution to improving the initial conditions by providing global information several times a day. As the quality of the EO products improves, the weather forecast also improves. \r\nSince decades, satellites are used to monitor and forecast weather. Therefore, it is one of the most established sectors of satellite data applications. There are geostationary and polar-orbiting weather satellites that measure all kinds of meteorologically relevant variables, e.g. cloud coverage, wind speed [...] via passive or active imagery. However, not only satellites are used to collect information, but also other remote sensing techniques that can be airborne or ground-based such as Lidar.\r\nWeather forecasts are used by citizens for decisions in everyday life, in agriculture for crop cultivation decisions and in the stock markets.

            "description": "Landslides are a natural hazard posing a threat to human life, property, infrastructure, and natural environment. Every year, slope instabilities have a significant impact on societies and economies. Consequently, landslide documentation is used for risk assessments, policy making and enforcing of construction regulations. Landslide monitoring is used to ensure safety of infrastructure operation. Rapid mapping of landslides and associated damages is done for response actions, e.g. of civil protection organizations. As ground surveys are very costly and time-consuming, satellite remote sensing is increasingly used to assess damage resulting from landslides.\r\nLandslides lead to local terrain changes after a downslope movement of material under the effect of gravity. They vary by type of movement (e.g. falling, toppling, gliding and flowing), by size (from small rocks to entire mountain slopes) and velocity (from a couple of millimetres per year up to free-fall speed). Landslides can be triggered both by natural causes (like earthquakes or heavy rainfall events) and human causes, e.g. mining activities that lead to slope failures. Landslides can initiate other natural hazards, e.g. when a landslide blocks a river a lake can be formed which poses a risk for an outburst flood. \r\nLandslides are diverse in appearance, and therefore are challenging to detect. EO-based assessment methods aim for detecting changes to the land surface and surface displacements. \r\nEO satellites and airborne remote sensing use optical sensors for detecting landslides in post-event images and land cover changes caused by landslides, primarily indicated by the removal of vegetation and the exposure of bare soil, by comparing pre-event and post-event images. Typical resolutions of optical EO data for mapping rapid landslides are between 0.4 m and 30 m, depending on the size of landslides caused by the triggering event. Optical data from unmanned aerial vehicles are used in cases where single landslides or concise regions have to be covered. Additionally, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors allow the detection of subtle changes in ground deformation caused by landslides. Therefore, time-series of radar images are used. Further, airborne laser scanning enables the generation of digital elevation models (DEMs) that allow identification of landslide surface structures and, in case of repeated coverage, detection of elevation changes. DEM generation for analysing landslides is also possible with photogrammetry on stereographic optical data and radargrammetry on SAR images.\r\nThe diversity of appearances of landslides leads to challenges for (semi-)automatic image processing and makes visual interpretation of EO data by a landslide expert a commonly used method for landslide mapping. However, visual interpretation is subjective and experts’ results can be very diverse. Additionally, it is a slow and time-consuming process. Semi-automated classification based on optical and DEM data using object-based image analysis (OBIA) can achieve detailed interpretations of landslides while reducing the analysis time. Interferometic SAR (InSAR) techniques, such as persistant scatterer interferometry (PSI) or Small Baseline Subset (SBAS), are primarily used to identify and monitor slow-moving landslides and for quantifying movement rates. Integrated analysis of optical, DEM and SAR data allow to fully exploit the potential of EO data from different sensors for landslide mapping and assessment.",

Ocean waters occupy large areas and involve highly dynamic processes with different temporal and spatial scales. In-situ measurements taken by ships and buoys can provide accurate information but only at specific locations, being limited to understand large-scale processes. To characterise the heterogeneity and dynamics of ocean waters, it would be required to perform exhaustive field campaigns with associated high costs and infrastructure challenges. EO is an efficient tool to monitor ocean waters and to complement ocean in-situ monitoring programmes as it can provide cost-effective information over vast areas at continuous temporal and spatial scales. \r\nSince the first EO satellite specifically designed to study the oceans (SeaSat) has been launch in the 1970s, many sensors and platforms have been developed. This variety of sensors have provided measurements of a broad range of ocean physical and biological variables to the present day. For example, satellite observations in the visible and near-infrared bands have provided information about ocean colour that can be used to estimate chlorophyll-a concentration for monitoring water quality, productivity and algal blooms. Thermal infrared (TIR) sensors have provided data of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) that is of importance for the study of currents and ocean warming. Microwave radiometers have registered sea surface salinity (SSS), critical to determine the global water balance, understanding ocean currents and estimating evaporation rates. EO can also provide information about physical ocean features such as surface elevation and ocean currents, sea surface winds, ocean waves, vessels and pollutants such as oil spills. \r\nThe versatility of EO data have been proved in a broad range of applications, including the monitoring of water quality, climate change effects, hurricane tracking and prediction, monitor maritime traffic and pollution, harmful algal blooms and fisheries management. In recent years, the Copernicus programme has launched a series of satellite missions for water and land monitoring that guarantee the provision of long-term observations giving continuity to previous satellite missions. Within the Copernicus programme, especially the Sentinel-3 mission will have relevance for ocean observations. Currently, two satellites Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B, launched respectively in 2016 and 2018, are providing near-real-time data on the state of the ocean surface, including sea surface temperature, marine ecosystems, water quality and pollution monitoring. New hyperspectral missions such as the Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) developed by NASA, are currently under development. In the near future, they will complement the existing satellite missions and will register data in a high number of spectral bands.

This includes ocean surface topography, ocean dynamics and circulation like tides and ocean current movements and drift, ocean winds, wave and climate conditions at ocean locations (meteocean). Further, this covers the mapping of extreme waves like tsunamis and the monitoring of hurricanes and typhoons. Involved EO technologies are for example satellite altimetry that maps ocean surface with 2 cm to 3 cm accuracy, mathematical forecast models. Repeated altimetry measurements allow mapping speed and direction of ocean's currents and tides. Available EO-based RADAR systems monitor wave height and direction, wind speed and sea-surface elevation. Near-realtime processing and delivery workflows enable the use of these parameters in weather forecasting, navigation and offshore installations protection.",

The main user needs to EO are to monitor, to map, to forecast, to assess, to detect, and to analyse. \r\nTo monitor means to watch and check a situation carefully for a period of time in order to discover something about it, i.e. keeping track of how the natural and manmade environment change (their status) over time. Typical alternative verbs are track, observe, record, follow, understand, or surveil. \r\nTo map means to represent an area of land in the form of a map, i.e. to feature and locate the way it is arranged or organized. Synonymous verbs are locate, identify, classify, trace, or record.\r\nTo forecast means to provide statements covering a range of different outcomes, to say what you expect to happen in the future; i.e. to predict future events based on specified assumptions (about information extracted from EO change and time series data), where different sets of assumptions describe scenarios. Equivalent terms are predict, plan, model, estimate, or project.\r\nTo assess means to judge or decide the amount, value, quality or importance of something, i.e. to evaluate and measure the status of and changes in natural and manmade built environments. Alternative verbs are evaluate, measure, understand, review, or quantify.\r\nTo detect allows to notice something that is partly hidden or not clear, or to discover something, especially using a special method, i.e. to identify and locate the changes in the Earth’s environment. Similar terms are locate, warn, identify, highlight, or spot.\r\nTo analyse means to study or examine something in detail, in order to discover more about it, i.e. to detail the elements of a whole and critically examine and relate these component parts separately and/or in relation to the whole.

            "description": "This knowledge area is about Web Based Geographic Information management aspects and therefore it was given the name \"Web Based GI\" or \"WBG\" in short. It is implied by this name that the differentiating factor for this KA is the \"Web\". One must then be able to answer the questions like \"What functions do we delegate to the Web?\" or \"how WBGI is different from the traditional GI?\" Sticking to the functions of a GIS, which are inserting (adding), storing, manipulating, analysing and presenting the data, there is not a single system for effecting all these tasks anymore but the Web itself. For instance, there is no single database and its known-to-its users-definition, anymore but many different stores and many different definitions. Similarly, many different manipulation, analysis and presentation options compared with the options offered by a single or limited number of systems of traditional GI. In general, Web provides the means of leveraging distributed \"resources\" like data, information, or software. It is a \"collaboration medium\". A collaboration that enables rapid production or decision making. A collaboration that certainly introduces new dimensions to traditional GI handling. This is the justification of proposing this KA in addition to the KAs of the original BoK. For the mentioned collaboration to happen, data or any other type of a resource have to accessible on the Web. This means that it should have a Web \"address\" and a \"definition\" that is understandable either by \"human\" or \"machine\". \"Machine understandable definitions\" refers to the dimension of \"semantics\" and \"ontologies\" which are also included under this KA. When one talks about publishing resources then \"catalogue services\" and more importantly \"discovery\" dimension comes into the scene. On the other hand, \"Linked Data (LOD)\" and \"Open Data\", highly popular recent trends and two of the above mentioned dimensions of Web GI have also been covered under this KA. Like the other dimensions of Web GI, both LD and OD aspects must be known to GI communities with differing degrees of expertise. The concepts of \"interoperability\" and \"Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI)\", hot topics of GI communities for many years, have been thought to be dealt with under this KA as well with the justification that \"Web GI\" is a much broader concept than SDI, This is by the fact that SDI refers to a much narrower content and context of \"collaboration\" then Web GI. Therefore, Geospatial data interoperability and some of the related concepts which were classified under KA, \"Geospatial data in the original BoK were moved under KA11 with the updated context. Another issue is the coverage of Spatial Analysis (SA), data manipulation aspects of GI by KA11. The SA aspects are covered by other KAs like \"Geocomputation\" and \"Analytical methods\". If the analysis operations, in an undertaking, would be handled by web services this is already covered by \"data processing\" web services, application development unit and Web services composition under that unit. The important thing is to have the knowledge about a specific analysis operation; Employing it as a web service would require no more knowledge than using any other web service. SA is covered by KA11 in as much as it should have been.",

WSC has been a highly active research topic since the emergence of Web services in 2000s. \"Manual\" WSC is the form that the activities of discovery, composition and invocation are all done manually (by human). In the \"Semi-automated\" way, the discovery is done by the machine. In the \"full-automated\" approach all the above activities are done by the machine. There are no tools at the moment that achieve full automated composition. Web API composition is like WSC, the only difference is the fact that instead of web services there are Web APIs in WAPIC. There is no doubt that One would run into the very same problems of WSC concerning full automated composition. In other words, WAPIC would in no way be easier than WSC. Nevertheless, as far as semi automated form can be achived, WAPIC is valuable because the number of Web APIs increase drastically from day to day. The site \"programmableWeb\" lists 14 957 APIs at the moment. It is not easy to search for all those APIs manually for the discovery of suitable APIs for a given task.",
